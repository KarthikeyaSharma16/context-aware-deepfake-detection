He was all lazy with it, at least Biden yelled his attack from within his inner gut 😂 lol!<sep>The blast that destroyed america<sep>I wanna see Trump do Ultrump Instinct.<sep>im not even a fan of DB but this is hilarious<sep>I&#39;ve read the manga<br><br>Pretty lit, specially the way it clashes to biden blast<sep>Why does he sound like The Rock ?<sep>Trump Tower Tarot card. (Jojo)<sep>Impossible. No one could have survived the Biden Blast. Unless their Power Level is...........Oh My God!!!!!!! It&#39;s over 9000!!!!!!!!<sep>Amazing power, but I&#39;m not so sure it was a good idea for him to have used the Obamehameha on random civilians in Syria.<sep>obama built like a brick shithouse<sep>YESS!<sep>bro looks like the rock<sep>Why is he a sayian warrior ( he should have had Goku’s outfit)<sep>This is going to be amazing when future society finds this thousands of years from now.<sep>DONALD DESTROY!!!!<sep>please do donald destroy next and make him a god of destruction and use hakai<sep>&quot;Big mikes husband&quot; 💀<sep>Why does he sound like a Starfield npc?<sep>DESTRUCTIVE FINISH!<sep>Nappa?

It appears to be a playful or humorous term, possibly combining &quot;Obama&quot; with the Hawaiian word &quot;Kamehameha,&quot; which refers to a legendary king in Hawaiian history.
<br>
<br>Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States, serving from 2009 to 2017. He is known for his political career and various policy initiatives during his time in office. The term &quot;Obamehameha&quot; does not have any real-world significance or meaning in relation to his actions or achievements.<sep>&quot;Today on why is this recommended...&quot;<sep><b>Trump obtained: Trump card (Ace of Spades)</b><sep>We need super saiyan Trump!<sep>lol<sep>Obamahamehaaaaa!<sep>Putin: &quot;there is no way You are beating this!!!!! Military draft attack!!!!&quot;<br>Obama: &quot;Damn, I gotta risk it, Tax increase times 4!!!!!&quot;<sep>Budokai 2 theme?! That&#39;s the best one! &lt;3<sep>What obama care should have been ...<sep>fix the voice, but the face looks great!<sep>Trump is still powering up!<sep>Anyone know the song at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aSoP0mDM0g&amp;t=18"">0:18</a>?<sep>Obama&#39;s limp wristed ass should have fired a blank. Big Mike has all the testosterone in that relationship.<sep>Diddy Kong: That&#39;s Even Better!<sep>Hahaha thanks Obamahameha!<sep>I need to see Obama and Joe staring at Trump while unleashing his power and Obama shouting &quot;is over 9000!&quot;<sep>I love how you put Obamas head on big mikes body. Just look at those sholders lol<sep><b>predator drone vaporizes small child</b><br><br>DRAMATIC FINISH!<sep>This shit is getting to uncanny valley levels lol<sep>Hopefully Algorithm blesses this video with views soon.<sep>music is too loud compared to the dialogue<sep>So even after getting a chaos emerald , he travelled to different realities to gain even more power<sep>BUT MASTER WHY NOT USE THE BAZINGA ATTACK !!<sep>funfact: Kamehameha was a real, Hawaiian ali&#39;i nui.<sep>Impressive like Saibamen , but still not as useless as Raditz 🤷🏼‍♂️😁<sep>Survived the Biden Blast and Obamehameha. How tf can you even beat this opponent.<sep>Now we need, Joe Biden &quot;Biden Blast&quot; vs Obama &quot;Obamehameha&quot;<br><br>Top 10 anime fights in history.<br>This will get number 1<sep>This is canon in real life.<sep>What&#39;s trump secret anime power?<sep>I don&#39;t know if his kamehameha will be good, but Obama bombing african and asian villages was the best 💯<sep>Damn this looks good! Haha<sep>DAMN<sep>That&#39;s awesome, BUT please turn down the music during dialogue.<sep>loooooooool<sep>Well now I&#39;m confused. I thought it&#39;s &quot;Sloppy Joe&quot; not &quot;Sleepy Joe&quot;.<sep>This is almost as powerful as his Cash for Clunkers program!<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭<sep>I hope Trump is goku to defeat Obama<sep>DRAMATIC FINISH!<sep>The only way Trumps will be able to survive this attack, he will have to unlock his ultimate, Super-Maga form!<sep>Still Pretty small when you think about it...just like his father Bardok when Frieza destroyed his entire planet.<sep>If I could I would double sub to you for a double TRUMP SUNDAY!!!<sep>Just hope he doesnt try his new power on space syria<sep>And when biden exposrs himself to a child and has a heart attack, it&#39;s called Final Flash.<sep>I was about to make a Great Ape joke before I realized how, uh, &quot;Hunter Biden&quot; it would sound. So, I won&#39;t.<sep>This is why he used drones. A blast could destroy the planet<sep>Anime Obamna<sep>Definitely looked real 👍<sep>He used that on kids in the middle east<sep>😂<sep>OBA! MAHA! CAAAAAAAAAARE!<sep>It&#39;s Mr. Obamna Ahmed Muhammud<sep>now he doesn&#39;t even need drones to deal with Yemen and Syria<sep>Shits fire not gonna lie<sep>10/10 - quality",1

It always depicts it very weirdly. Since it isnt exactly alive &amp; definitely isnt human. And it hasnt really gotten to observe actual humans in action that much. So obviously it doesn&#39;t understand these things. And if it does it has a very bery basic understanding. Likely without really grasping and or getting how its actually done. And without being able to fathom how it really works. A.I. is basically certainly not actually sentient or alive in any way. And it hasn&#39;t had much observation of humans. Definitely not with a more super intelligent mind. It almost always shows food falling out of the person&#39;s mouth with out of place chewing sounds. Like it actually went in their mouth. And a whole lot of the clips show pple struggling to simply eat. They&#39;re bumping all around the sides of their mouth and above n below it when they go to take a bite.

Well unless AI benefits from ALL written content on the internet in which case I REALLY can&#39;t avoid helping AI but I&#39;ll TRY to avoid helping as much as I possibly can because that shit seriously scares me. It&#39;s crazy awesome for entertainment like this, which is AMAZING entertainment and IF I had the money right now I&#39;d donate some, I swear (literally less than a dollar in my bank account right now...) I would donate something even if it&#39;s just $10 or $20 which well if a TOTAL STRANGER gives you that much money randomly, that isn&#39;t &#39;just.&#39; It&#39;s &#39;holy shit someone gave me money for making some funny crap online.&#39; For one out of appreciation, but for two because ME WANT MORE! So if I had a HUNDRED dollars of &#39;disposable income&#39; I&#39;d... well no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d give $100, but $20 would be perfectly fine, I&#39;m enjoy the heck out of this and this video is basically a little YouTube Skyrim AI political comedic videogame-related masterpiece.<br><br>And I mean that. Less than 10 minutes and I basically laughed so hard I had to pause the video I think at least three times, likely each time hitting the left-arrow key on my keyboard to go back 5 seconds and re-watch the scene/delivery. Because it&#39;s just... chef&#39;s kiss. As I quipped recently, &quot;Goes together like Italians and fingertips.&quot; Never heard it before but I love it as a cultural reference and a bit of wordplay. Because TECHNICALLY I mean it as Italians bringing their fingertips together in a prominent fashion, possibly in a way a means to help communicate via body language. You know EXACTLY what I mean, because if you say &quot;Fu&#39;get about it&quot; in a stereotypical Italian-American accent.... your shoulders MAY WELL be hunched and you MAY WELL be making a virtually exact recreation of the hand gesture used for a &#39;chef&#39;s kiss,&#39; but just moving the fingers a bit before you all point upwards rather than bringing the fingertips to your face and kissing them... which uh, in retrospect and with germ theory, nothing agains culinary culture/tradition, but maybe not the most hygienic thing to do lol Especially if you don&#39;t then immediately wash your hands before handling other people&#39;s food. I mean if I&#39;m making a sandwich and I just KNOW I&#39;m not leaving home until I finish this sandwich, I could lick my hands like some disgusting fiend and construct that sammich with gross saliva-coated hands and well it&#39;s just generally gross and weird and concerning but if I&#39;m the only one eating it? I mean... some poor individual out there might have a disorder where they spit on EVERY meal they EVER eat. Even in restaurants. Which is a horrific thought but given some people&#39;s weird ticks out there, including tourettes and general OCD-related stuff, yeah. McDonald&#39;s cheeseburger? P&#39;tew! A smoothie at the mall? Lid off, p&#39;tew, lid on, drink.<br><br>... Actually, that might be kind of a good habit for people who might for one reason or another have a phobia, like a LITERAL phobia, of people sneaking sips/bites while not looking, which come it that TOTALLY is a thing with SOME poor individuals out there and I suspect MORE than one person out of 7 or 8 or 9 billion people has that.<br><br>... Though for people with a phobia of people sipping/sampling your food/drink when not looking, OR spitting in it when you&#39;re not looking, well I don&#39;t see how it would help prevent the spitting one.<br><br>It&#39;s sad, what some people go through with certain phobias. As Trump the not-so-Sole-Survivor says, &quot;Big sad,&quot; but well I think in that case it&#39;s just a depiction of a clearly very narcissistic fictional take of Trump in FO4 and not not ACTUAL Donald Trump caring more about a fictional &#39;Trump Steak&#39; business that he apparently ran pre-war but he doesn&#39;t remember it but apparently likes them and his lame choice (though considerate and caring choice of the pre-war version of Trump who pursued those friends consciously or unconcsiously) but some of them to help him out, so that&#39;s... interesting. Ugh, and not only living near but being &#39;FRIENDS&#39; with both Steven Colbert and Jimmy Fallon? Or at leas being friends with Colbert but apparently Fallon being close enough to get to the vault within like 10 minutes or whatever of the sirens going off?<br><br>Ugh... but well, at least he doesn&#39;t seem to have a skooma-addicted son. I hope Don jr is doing well, and I hope Hunter cleans up his act or already has... he&#39;s kinda become a major national joke and a point of humiliation for his father, whether or not Joe is... aware... that it&#39;s mainstream and HILARIOUS to make jokes about that. I mean that&#39;s another thing that made me stop and laugh, the mere thumbnail of &#39;Joevahkiin&#39; or however it&#39;s spelled and Hunter having a Skooma pipe... that is FOUR TIMES just TODAY that this &#39;Phoxotic&#39; autistic AI genius (and possibly amateur body-actor? I suspect the actual owner of this channel appears in at least the FO4 series but don&#39;t know for sure) has made me bust a gut laughing. And one of them is just from a THUMBNAIL!<br><br>So yeah, do some people hate this content? Probably, and if so, that&#39;s confusing because this is just GOLD to me, but I have an app on my web browser that lets me see likes/dislikes. Here they are, as of RIGHT NOW as I type on June 2, 2023 (depending on your part of the world, it could be a different date due to time zones existing). Er, no wait, uh, as of WHEN I CLICKED OR REFRESHED the video, but you get what I mean, minutes old, shouldn&#39;t be many thumbs in either direction right now 10 months after being uploaded in this short span of... minutes.<br><br>24k Thumbs Up<br>(24,400 specifically)<br><br>307 Thumbs Down<br><br>My 15+ year experience on YouTube has over time shown me that if a video has 90% or 95% Thumbs Up, it&#39;s clearly generally well-liked, with 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 (or more) who review, leaving a positive review. And that ratio? Well if it was 90% Up, there&#39;d be 2.4k Down votes. 99% Thumbs Up (quite common with genuinely good/captivating/intriguing/interesting/insightful/funny videos that don&#39;t tend to offend anyone or cause controversy) would be 240 Thumbs Down.<br><br>So we&#39;re at like... 98.5% or 98.75% or something like that I think ACTIVELY saying &quot;Hey, this is lit, fam.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s new/innovative due to the thorough use of both visual/audio AI, it&#39;s hilarious, it&#39;s political but in a relevant way (even 10 months later, obviously, he hasn&#39;t died or been somehow impeached out of office or gone through a medical emergency that necessitates him to step down because of like a coma or something), the writing/jokes is just stellar making it generally great for keeping true to the source material of where Joe was sent... and it&#39;s in the reviews.<br><br>Almost 25,000 people voted, and my rough estimate is that somewhere around maybe 98.5-98.75% of them opted to give a Thumbs Up.<br><br>And well, getting sponsors...<br><br>It&#39;s obvious, even moreso given THIS video is sponsored and was posted TEN MONTHS AGO. So it goes without saying. Dr. Phoxotic, this innately nerdy individual or someone getting the help of/hiring an innately nerdy individual who has figured out how to utilize AI for visual/audible humor, this incredible autistic genius or the genius(es) in the team helping to create this... I mean, this is outstanding.<br><br>Feels like I&#39;m trying to do a Trump impression, I&#39;m not. This crap is mind-blowing and I love it and I can&#39;t wait to see more AI comedy. It still scares me... but at least it can make me laugh while I fear it attempting to obliterate humanity from the face of the Earth from becoming possessed by woke climate change WEF anti-human politics and deeming humanity a cancer on the world that will lead to the planet&#39;s and by extension potentially the AI&#39;s own existence to climate-related self-destruction of some sort from which maybe Earth can take down what man had made and be renewed to be more pure and &#39;good&#39; without pesky &#39;humans&#39; running around, farting like cows, but even worse driving around and working and cooking burgers at restaurants which contribute to pollution because of climate change and the food chain and a rabbit only eats greens but a coyote who eats rabbits basically is consuming the energy that was collected of that rabbit&#39;s plant-eating for its ENTIRE life thus that coyote technically needs WAAAAY more plant matter to survive to sustain its food which makes it a bigger carbon footprint thus meat is evil to eat and blah blah blah blah.<br><br>Leftism is anti-human. That includes Biden and Trudeau and thankfully left-in-the-childless-history-books Angela Merkel whose genes will die with her it seems.<sep>Impossible to choose a favorite moment from this piece of comedy perfection<sep>i wouldn&#39;t be mad if ai takes over the world because it made this masterpiece possible.<sep>Imagine this series with the new ai technology.

Chuthulu isn&#39;t a giant squid monster, that is just what we can comprehend in the moment.

Presidential dad jokes.<sep>What is that Russian &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; doing in this video!?  He really doesn&#39;t belong with the rest of these people.<br>REASONS WHY &quot;PIGSHIT PUTIN&quot; DOESN&#39;T BELONG IN THIS VIDEO:<br><br>1. He&#39;s from Russia - the rest are from the United States.<br>2. &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; started an unprovoked WAR with its neighbor, Ukraine.<br>3. &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; doesn&#39;t believe that Ukraine really is a sovereign country. Well dude, the Ukrainian people are sure fighting like one!  Слава Україні! (Slava Ukrayini! - Glory to Ukraine!)<br>4. To date, &quot;Pigshit Putin&#39;s&quot; WAR has lead to the deaths of over 500,000 men, women and children. <br>5. &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; has suppressed the truth in his own country; imprisoned his opponents; ordered the murder of those who defied him; hijacked the Russian electorial system; dragged his young men into a brutal, unprovoked war; bombed non-military targets in Ukraine like hospitals, residential buildings and theatres; abducted Ukrainian children and taken them to Russia AND is committing heinous crimes against humanity even as I write this.  <br><br>&quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; is a War Criminal and there is an arrest warrant out for him by the International Criminal Court (ICC).<br><br>Maestro, are you trying to make &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; look like a legitimate and responsible world leader by placing him among this group?   If so, WHY!?<br><br>Why not create a separate series of videos featuring OTHER murderous thugs like &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; - and have them &quot;crack jokes&quot; and &quot;rationalize&quot; their evil deeds. You might put Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, and Nero in with &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; - as they are all cut from the same cloth. I&#39;m sure their &quot;antics&quot; will give us all such a &quot;belly laugh&quot; (sarcasm intended).<br><br>Maestro, I really enjoy the concept of your video series but I don&#39;t understand why &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; is included in your videos? He doesn&#39;t exactly &quot;fit&quot; with the others in your witty creations. Believe me, &quot;Pigshit Putin&quot; adds nothing positive to them.   <br><br>PLEASE DELETE &quot;PIGSHIT PUTIN&quot; FROM YOUR OTHERWISE BRILLIANT VIDEO SERIES.

<br>
<br>In the game Skyrim, players take on the role of the Dragonborn, a customizable character who embarks on various adventures throughout the fantasy world. It&#39;s not possible for real-world individuals like Joe Biden to be present or participate in the game&#39;s universe.

I absolutely love your humour on all your videos (by the way I&#39;m a big Dr Peterson fan)<sep>Missed a difference, Biden complied and returned all the documents as soon as he was probed. Trump didn&#39;t.<sep>Propaganda.<sep>Did you... did you really just call trump smart? Not to defend Biden but the difference is he and Clinton, flawed as they are, actually declasified the mostly personal documents first. Also Trump is a far bigger criminal when it comes to other matters as well<br><br>Also, most people who vote democrat don&#39;t like that party, they just dislike the only other choice more<sep>Everyone was so sassy lol thats great.<sep>Tyson: &quot;It&#39;s eating my mustache.&quot; 😂😂😂<sep>That wasn&#39;t Coomer 😑<br>And &quot;Gary&quot; is Walter.<sep>It upsets Mt that this has few views for how well written it is<sep>This is your best writing yet.

XDDD<sep>PLEASE MAN MAKE MORE OF THIS I SPEAK FOR MANY OF US :D<sep>Great work, man. Thank you.<sep>Im subbing, i like the humor in these<sep>this is really bad<sep>This is proof the right cant meme or do comedy<sep>&quot;Both sides&quot; means pretending Trump didn&#39;t steal hundreds of classified docs on his way out of office. K<sep>This wouldn&#39;t have happened if Gordon just cleaned his room<sep>This is exactly the kind of premium content we need on this godforsaken website.<sep>Half life is the best game.

Some of the comedic timing is a little off, but overall pretty funny and well made!<sep>I love how you made Peterson slightly annoyed by everyone&#39;s failed attempts to get his jokes.<sep>This is phenomenal. How did yo make this with AI?<sep>as someone who follows Peterson&#39;s work and has finished Half Life 1 for the first time a few days ago, this is so good.<sep>I had the music turned off when I was playing these games, and I forgot that Half-Life even had any background music at all.

How did you do this?<sep>I like how you were super realistic with jordan peterson not recognizing that 1984 by orwell is a pro-socialist book written by a socialist<sep>Gordon, sorry, Jordon. lmao<sep>Mother of god.. Is this masterpiece made with the help of AI?<sep>Yeah but Jordan Peterson is no way this fun and charming. Here Jordan is like a normal human being.<sep>this is genuinely some of the funniest shit I have ever seen, had to watch it twice lol<sep>Now I&#39;m waiting for a lecture in some university from that guard on the entrance<sep>You’ve managed to actually improve the start of half life and added to each little detail at the start. Who else could make looking through Freeman’s locker at the start more entertaining.<sep>the satire is so heavy-handed it&#39;s kind of pathetic<sep>It sounds a lot more like Peterson at 1.25 speed",1

I believe these are old video clips put together!😮?!!!?🎉<sep>Facts check: All these disturbing clowns make my day when I&#39;m having a bad day. 🎉🤣😂🤣<sep>Its AI folks<sep>Well, I think it’s important that if the invisible man needs a job to pay bills or or whatever he hast to get some kind of a job and Meghan explain that to me that Ryan, when he came back from the war, he had problems I guess I don’t know because Ryan blame me for Getting him in trouble and throwing him in jail for huffing paint out of a sock and I didn’t know what that was I thought he was trying to kill himself. He had a cigarette lighter on the on the workbench all the white spray paint cans on the floor that he had previously huffed. I didn’t even know what huffing paint was I thought people were getting high off of the fumes and that’s why my workbench was like right by the garage door entrance And the spray paint was in the boxes. I bought it by the caseload for different things like not all at once, but if I bought it and I could get a case I would get a case so I didn’t do anything wrong. I called 911 thinking I need help he was out of control and they put him in Jail And I told him go to the psychiatry in Durango and ask for Dr. Garcia in psychiatry know instead, Tommy bailed him out so at that time I wasn’t that well myself and I’m on all kinds of narcotics, OxyContin and Percocet breakthrough pain medicine so you know technically I was taking drugs, but I wasn’t taking them like Ryan says, or abusing them or selling anything and he got into both mine and David’s medication and when he was here on his family leave to take care of me he was taking medication that was stored in the kitchen cabinet. I had a bottle of oxy Cotton from I guess maybe 2001 it was and he was accusing me of being a drug addict and a drug dealer and he couldn’t be around me Mr. big time and What does he do? In the meantime he had another bottle of Vicodin and it was gone, and when he was at Auren‘s house, he took a bottle of hydrocodone out of the medicine cabinet and his was gone and he was drinking wine like it was water I don’t know how many bottles of wine he went through here, but does he realize that the world was listening to him The whole time he was here they don’t believe me that my house is monitor I tell them upfront. And that when he does this to himself he was trying to come home and helped me he was partying at my house and Auren was there with me and Ryan had no right to take away my safety net when he had to drive to the airport to take Ryan to the airport Ryan had more money 💰 to get himself to the airport and Margaret asked me “After this do you think you can live with Ryan?” I told her no and he needs to sign himself into The Betty Ford Center in California and do not leave it until cleared by themselves and go through treatment and you can come home when you have achieved sobriety accordingly the AA way not your way or my way or someone else way you need to stop and think about not ever seeing My granddaughters are to important to me you have to think about your own family and own life and you are on the path to inialate yourself so go ahead if it makes you feel better blame me like the ten years you lost out on the opportunity to speak in a conversation with me. You and Auren talk at me. You listen to whoever you want to and frankly I don’t think you would not be where you are without me. You two are not destroying me neither is anyone else so go get your act together and let me know when you’re done! Bye😊❤ now and love Andrew you need help get off this case no matter how you try it is drugs with I do not know Andrew so you are not alone in this world you need to listen to your father<sep>The alphabet is possibly Bobby or something like that and I have nothing else I can do. But will try to get her bedroom a mattress and she watched my Yorkie for me during him threatening to kill her and people are in trouble who sliced her toe off and Megan is no she is not it was Pat Mc Kiernan took credit for that. She said she was cloning her and selling puppies so the money 💰 would buy me a new house and she and Tommy and Tracy swing around together and I want no more contact with her and she was paid by Megan to destroy me and David and Ireland and Michael and she threatened to do the same things to Michael as she did to Irelan and they needed a spotter living where David sat at the kitchen table and he watched Many years ago them changing wiring in my telephone box so she listened to me on the phone and called CPS and Mari<br>Cops and she was in the Dahlia behind the house close to the Pima Road on the cul de sac on Dahlia and Auren was playing with Eddy and Kerry until David got called to give his house to Nancy because they wanted to put me in prison and told me if I did not get out of my own house they would make sure I went to prison. Toxic people I have not ever met anyone as evil as them and she hAs a prostitution ring that she wanted me to join her and Tracy she liked him and I told her no way she played Bingo and had a husband who Matt was going to college and I am not sure if she cheated on anyone because he knew what she did when he met her this way and that was something she was doing back then out in Fountain Hills Casino and she was making money 💰 claimed it was from Bingo and I honestly don’t walk in a casino in Arizona<sep>I think May ok yes you guys can ask my brother John F Kennedy Jr I would say to see what he says about it. <br>I am going home now all of the time<sep>A brain transplant is a serious problem for anyone’s health and joking around like he does when he sent around reels claiming that he had to have a port put in himself and he had a IV You hurt people with the way you treated me and you hurt people I know who survived a port and you do not deserve me or anything from me until you go straighten out my banking and social security and you still will not ever work with me or my family you needed your head examined a long time ago when you tried to ruin my life with them because they were paying him money for your stuff and what you did with them instead of me you slept in the wrong bed with the wrong people and you have no idea what you gave up doing what you did to me I am so over you and good  luck 🍀<sep>Ryan you need a sponsor from Cocaine Annymous who will help you with your life. You had me at your side and you left mine when you went off on me asking me “Why don’t you die?” “other people were asking me What kind of a alien are you that you won’t die every time you die you come back, and I need to know what kills an Alien like you! <br><br>I told him when he went off on my Godfather Herb and he was on FaceTime with me. I hung up and the consequences of all of his own actions are not going away and I do not have any reason to trust anyone else who is involved with Tommy and Tracy and Megan and Jimmy you people choose wrong people and make wrong decisions on how your arrogance  dictated your own future you frankly all of you overboard now sinking pirates 🏴‍☠️ off my ships have no respect for anybody but yourselves and your own people and you had years to work this out with me and ask your questions about me and instead you believed everybody else and frankly got into bed with the wrong person and lost your life and job over not having any respect for me and my family and not ever speaking to me yourself or writing me just putting spy’s on me and my friends and family and you did not know who was holding the gold ring 💍 and invited you and went out of my way everyday for you and you did not like how I look so no further explanation to your cockamamie do not know how to operate put my whereabouts on the line and created open season hunting season on my life with Tom O Tracy O and Megan and Jimmy when you thought you could steal Donny Straubs Stamps and pin it on me and sell stamps and hood ornaments and your grandfather bailed you out of Roseland NJ and you were doing drugs because CPS told Joey that he had nothing wrong with him that I diagnosed Ryan myself and that he did not have to continue at Dr Spector or Dr Bartley because Dawnese Hustead said he had no such thing as bipolar disorder and he did not need medication m<br>Prescription for his medication was Imparmine Dr Hazel MD psychiatrist Scottsdale AZ <br>Ryan went to him <br>Dr Benjamin and Dr Jensen both wrote the report on his individual treatment program tha was mailed to me to submit to the Scottsdale School District <br>Myself I did this myself for Ryan when everybody else was telling me nothing is wrong with Ryan it’s his school that is his problem Patty Mc Kiernan was sueing the Scottsdale School Board for Jeffrey not doing well at school. She hated Terry Renfro and she did not understand her own problems never mind Jeffrey’s problems and Eddy was not doing well either I said he did not hear properly and go take both<br>Of them to a doctor and she couldn’t understand how I got help f<br>For Ryan without any medical insurance or anything else. Well what you don’t know won’t hurt you.<br><br>So I did not continue in that friendship because too many things were out of place over there to have any contact myself during a battle onsueing with CPS that Megan was paying her to say bad things about me and spy on me because Megan believed everything that she said and did not even speak with me about my daughter herself because she was so jealous of Irelan that instead of hiring a nurse and following three different doctors orders for all of me and my children to have a nurse in place to provide a safety net to care for four of us together and allow us to get well together in our own home and our own family and own house she tried to kill me by giving Irelan to Debbie Shalow over the phone 📱 in Children’s Hospital in Phoenix because I was laying by my daughter Irelans side inside her crib and both of us finally were asleep and The nurse saw us and left us alone together. Mommy walked in and started screaming “Get her out of that crib she is going to break Irelans leg again if she rolls over on her she is too big to be sleeping in a crib!”<br>So they made me get out of the room bc my family’s are saying I am mental and not on the right medication because I am sleeping in a crib.<br><br>This is exactly what they do method of controlling clarevoyant people by getting them pinned down with a DSM IV and making up stories about them to other people when they do not know me and have spent zero time with me since I shared a room with Megan on Baker Road I know who she associate with but I do not go around telling other people whatever goes on under my roof stayed under my roof and they both Tommy and Megan knew that about me and whenever they were scared or made mistakes they were crying to me and I knew everything about them. Until I moved to Arizona and began out by telling my Pastor Harry Thomas and he prayed with me that I was hearing from God when I told him when I last had Robert Bugai walk out on me infront of everybody At Come Alive was waiting to greet him and he walks out of the building and tells me he can not stay for lunch with my kids never mind me but my kids were with Martin and Chris kids wanting to say hello to himself and he goes to the doorway of the highschool and leaves the parking lot in a car I think he had his own blue hatchback but he came from DC the day before exhaustion and shirt collar untied tie hanging off him like he had just been with someone else in DC and I did not realize he was going to prostitues or anything like that until now and the investigation Canadian Authorities have been trying to get him to pay the money 💰 for the charges against him for hacking Chase Manhattan Bank 17 times 7 years straight and he destroyed my account and debit cards and had my son Auren in his pocket with his wallet and wallet in my house was stolen from my house inside of my pocket book 📕 and I had written him a couple of small checks and mailed them to him in North Arlington NJ from Chase Manhattan Bank and the Bank cleared them I believe I do not get checks back from the bank cancelled checks from my account <br>I only paid him under 100 dollars for his film 🎞️ of his pictures that he took of bilboards overseas and refused to take them with him and it turns out he was helping Megan he and Tommy and his boyfriend Jimmy OTT were planting evidence of himself in Russia 🇷🇺 with Ken Dawson and Ken Strayley taking pictures of bilboards on highways and not explaining to me why are you giving these to me and I work for Koreans what would I want with Russian Bilboards and advertising in Korean not The Russians and he was trying to make me loose my status as a businessman store manger interior designer he used me paid by My money 💰 that Megan was jealous of me and him and tried to pay him off to set me up and walk away from me and my boys and parents and make me loose everything again so she could get into the company and not me. <br>And I kept telling myself to get him out of my apartment and we had a argument about him not taking the pictures with him they were an insult to me and he did nothing wrong all he did was walk away leaving 2 envelopes of them behind and I had no use for them myself and he refused to come get them so I put them out on the porch and by the time couple days went by maybe a week. The lady upstairs came out. I was laying on the Hamic and the pictures were still out there and I had another bag of garbage and she says I wanna take the garbage out and go back and will burn it so I said oh I’ll come with you and I took them and I showed them to her and I said you know he didn’t come back for these and that shit they went on fire and what did I do wrong? I didn’t do anything wrong and why were they setting me up I didn’t do anything wrong everything I did my boss Congaree knew about. He even knew about me going down in the afternoons to have lunch at Roberts house and we were together so come on trying to set me up when I had a good job and I was kind to him. He didn’t have anything he didn’t even have a car and he was in trouble with credit cards that he got in trouble away at college. He told me in Alabama and that his father had to bail him out and then he was working on paying back his father that’s where he got his credit cards from was Joseph Bugai he worked at the hospital and my Mother liked him so she had him for dinner but she told me herself alone not to marry him that his family did not have enough money to keep up with me. And she liked Rob but she told me he was not material for CT and that she had no reason to not allow me to go there she did not want him to go there because she wanted to hide our money and protect me from people exploiting me and my talents and Satanism and kept me not knowing anything about any of how this worked and no one else explained any of it to me I always thought if they wanted to tell<br>Me they would tell me but they did not know what to believe when the Cry baby coddled kid got jealous himself of everything I did including race horses and he had to proove he could do that himself because he wanted to be groomed to be a president and he had the wrong education when we tried to help him out and see what he would do if he got into private school and he hated it like everything else and couldn’t swing a baseball ⚾️ bay with me and Terry and cried whenever he was outside away from his Mother Teresa and then he now expects to come live here in my house as a Satanist and they think all of them that they can do exactly what I do if they could only get me out of here and have the house and my stuff and books because they destroyed me every time I was close to anything that they wanted.<br><br>Non Disclosure Agreement NDA <br>No more interviewing online <br><br>Contact my sister Ambassador Caroline Kennedy Shlossberg and when statement to the press is available she will be able to answer any questions thank you Q<sep>Ryan you had a FMLA federal legal paperwork done for me. You were supposed to be here for me by today but you choose to spend your money 💰 on the life you lead the other people you support who you said “Yes Margaret is making more money than I am making now but I’m paying taxes so you can sit home doing nothing you are on the wrong medicine and I am not helping you with anything because I pay taxes everyday I go to work and I have taxes taken out of my own paycheck to pay for your social security benefits and I’m not paying any more money 💰 for you and he said “If you don’t pay the rent I am going to put you in Alaska!”<br><br><br>He told me to go clean houses and make my own money 💰! <br>And Auren and Tommy were trying to figure out where all of the money I spent on myself to do my job. Came from. I do not have to tell you anymore! NDA<br><br>And you people owe me a car so you need to pay me for it! <br>The social security has nothing to do with me anymore! <br>You both all of you pirates did this to yourselves and I can not help you! <br>I awnser for everything not everyone else!<br>You stole the sun woffer from my sound bar<br>Eat out of the peanut butter jar<br>Come steal books 📕 from me <br>You are trying to stop me <br>From fulfilling my Destiny and you have no clue any of you who are partaking in this <br>Have no idea even who I am so good luck finding yourselves <br>Goodbye I waited long enough for anyone to come home and hold a conversation with me without calling me mental or trying to talk at me! You have not heard anything yet about me and my life expectancy has run out of time for you people are not going anywhere!<sep>That has to be Ryan or something at the airport and I know that you are trying to get a new job and I can only say as a friend that I have asked you to come home so many times and you did not come home to discuss anything with me, you are not under my authority you are under The Holy See and I suggest if you have a chance to speak with your Priest and try really try to be truthful with him alone by yourself with no drugs no alcohol in your body to give a stronghold again or leave one door open to allow anyone else’s spirit to influence the mind that he gave to you and remember that He is not going to leave you or forsake you and I was trying to save you myself many times when you were little I was able to rescue you from everything that happened to you and now with everything that the enemy has done to you and every single time you have been in trouble like when your Dad and Marianne had to kick you out your father begged me to leave you alone and I in all good conciousness did not understand what you were trying to do Joey and after the fact that he lived with me and I saved his life from “White Paint I told him he could have anything of mine he wanted outside in the garage he had a bedroom and every other thing he needed besides a shower and my computer upstairs he was allowed to come upstairs also and work on the computer and he was outside in the garage holding his tube basketball socks up to his face and had his cigarette 🚬 lighter on the work bench I had for myself I told him he could use anything he needed to do or use tools for flower 🌸 arrangements for Sue our clients extra paint cans I had paint for Gingers house still<br>Backup paint spray paint Auren painted out of paint box I used to carry around with certain people I knew like Melanie painted in her house and other people that were doing the work with us and Ryan knew the spray paint for the wicker furniture from Pier One Import was expensive and the wicker had to be maintained or it frays apart from the wood 🪵 and I had it in my homes throughout my life I had t many things that I had bought the stuff and other things that I made with all of my things that I collected garbage hunting around our house and Dad asked me not to take Auren garbage collecting stuff and I told him you would not believe me the stuff that I had found out in the sidewalks and garbage collection was unbelievable and we went out garbage hunting together with Pongo and we came back with his wagon full of stuff and Daddy could not get over what other people were talking about and he said he had no idea what to believe because David paid for everything he bought and I had Furniture I bought that Dad knew that my check had bounced back and He had to explain that I was not sure what was going on with my money and I was just like you are but no one else was there and we honestly Pat and Matt were moving to Maryland and I got a office credenza off the sidewalk in front of their house and they were all over the place and I left it I did nothing to change it and it was visible in Ryan’s garage and I got a metal sofa a porch sofa and cushions down the street from my condo a lady gave it to me when I lived alone in the condominium and she was outside in her garage and I had Rosey and she told me I could put it out in my garage and I did not see much of her again I stuck to myself because they were trying to kill me and David had heard chatter on the streets and he hid me up on Bell Road in a motel and it was on the right side of the street before you turn right to go to John Cabbot by the Arrowhead Mall and most of the time I was in the mall like I bought the cake topper Cinderella inside the Disney Store while he was getting the truck and Ryan was there I left my computer in place for him to use the door oh yeah before I moved in the motel with my dogs Pongo and Rosey were with me in the motel room it is a pet friendly motel room and they were allowed to be outside on a leash with me in the pool 🏊‍♀️ and I was only away from them when I was in the mall and I went to ATT to get two cell phones 📱 so that David and I could communicate during the road trip to WA State and as I was packing up some stuff beforehand this guy a neighbor who owned a row of condos lined Orangewood Avenue in front of the entrance to the condo parking lot from Orangewood? Ave I think and 19 Ave traffic light is out of the entrance and if you are standing in the pool you should see the outside entrance to the street inbetween the building where they live inside the house 🏡 of that row of condos that if you walk out of the pool and walking out facing 19 avenues you turn left into the parking lot. Go straight out the entrance in front of you leads out to Orangewood and you turn to your left and they owned or told me that they owned that entire row of townhomes 🏡 and they lived in the second one in from the driveway leading out to Orangewood and kept their garage door open all of the time and had a office to pay rent for their tenants that lived in the building and they were buying up condos and told me they hoped one day to own everything and he came in my garage and wanted to pay me for my kitchen door which was a dead light glass wood core door that for privacy I painted the glass window purple and designed a pattern on it that he liked and was trying to stuff my pockets of my shorts with cash money when I told him that the doors came with the condo and he persisted and said “You have insurance 💰 money!” I said”This is not my condo it belongs to my Mother and she bought it and I am selling it and I am selling it exactly as I bought it and the doors were on it when I bought it and you can not take them off of my house with your own tools and take this filthy cash 💰 of yours and if you are trying to pay 💰 me any money 💰 then go buy your own glass doors at Home Depot and get out of my garage and I was not having any garage sale and I threw the money 💴 out of my pocket at himself and he did not return. I then after we already moved to this house where I am now. I had been through hell with everybody else trying to figure out how to buy figure skating equipment myself and I had no money 💴 to do it myself and none of my children believed I could skate again to loose weigh I would not have gotten fat and my son Auren said “Go rent skates first and see if you still even can stand up!” Cursed me. I told him “I have never been on a rental skate in my entire life and nobody can stand up on ice properly in a rental skate I will get killed on ice if I try to skate again and I do not have proper fitted skates that the blades are balanced for my weight and height and abilities and they will<br>Have to be broken in before I even stand on ice and I got someone over at a skating club<br>On the Lakewood mall Rink I have a friend who’s sister skated there so they said of course I could come get fitted for skates and Auren said the skates were too expensive for me to go rent skates in Bremerton so I could kill myself!” That’s what happens when I got on rental plastic cheap skates from somebody else who knew Tommy knew I was going to get hurt and I have nothing but pain from himself he should be put to death for everybody else he harmed as well! <br><br>My figure skates were right where I told him they were in that condo and the NSA knows how I found them you idiots!good bye to you! Why he refused to go there to investigate is because he and Tracy paid them to destroy the building after they told them the night we pulled into Las Vegas that they claim that they went to see what I had taken from the building and they were surprised that I left so much furniture there and other pieces of artwork from my grandparents in CT and stuff. Well I was not there I was living somewhere else and Ryan I told him to take what he wanted to take and leave anything else so they would have things for the Yum Yum Tree which was supposed to be a family investment of my parents money 💰 and he said that it was all there that night but the next day nothing was there and Aunt Patricia told me this . That when they went back they found the windows were removed from the house and no doors 🚪 were left on the building.” <br><br>She asked me if I had anybody there I told her Ryan was there and he has friends there but David was there and he loaded the truck alone with Ryan and he paid for the truck and moving so I know he would never do anything like this <br><br>And then Tommy says “I know you did not do it but you paid somebody else to do it!” And I told him “With What!” And go check on the guy who was trying to pay cash 💰 for doors taking them off himself out in my garage alone the garage door was open and after David heard about it he moved me out of the place. <br>You told me I “Crazy Talk!” And that no one else had my figure skating equipment with a tracer and he tells me”What am I supposed to do? WALK UP TO THE HOUSE AND GO ASK FOR YOUR FIGURE SKATES? The whole world will think I am crazy like you for doing something like that!<sep>What a disgrace to this nation..... 🫤😲<sep>If you want to see what the zoo looks like your watching it....

Biden couldn&#39;t explain crap to his Son... He&#39;s always stoned.<sep>The silent staring after each joke makes it funnier<sep>Pat and Matt Mc Kiernan Took credit for slicing off one of my tea cup Yorkies toes and I caught whoever by surprise stealing Williams of Sonoma Dishes out of my kitchen placed on 3 tier and two tier wrought iron wracks and on my kitchen countertop next to the kitchen sink in the kitchen. I asked them when I saw it with their mystery meat inside of it to bring back Our Families Dishes To Our Restaurants or else they never did anything about what happened to me they are being held <a href=""http://accountable.mc/"">accountable.Mc</a> Kiernan said she was going to clone the dog and make money to help me get a new house! Robert Bugai has threatened to kill my family and my brother<sep>Since I got shot by a biological weapon three years ago, by the supposed of Rick Williams, former military, I don’t know what country he said United States, but he lives like a thief and he comes in my house like a ghost and he says his son Rick Junior is running the program out of Cheyenne Mountain and he told me that my godfather Herbert T Berry was paying him to investigate me and monitor my house and that’s not true. It was Tom OConnell, TracyVanKirk, and Megan not paying him with a Jimmy Ott and so all these people have been listening to me with all your world leaders and all they want to stop in in the war is for me to leave and get out and give them the house so that they have a place to live because I don’t know where they are? And Williams admitted test shooting me and he said it was ordered that he was just following orders, so what did Mafiosa Megan do with father Burns when they went into talk to the president who knows which one we have so many? and she’s so jealous of me that she doesn’t like it that I am in charge of figure skating and that I can teach anyone how to figure skate in one weekend, or at least stand up on ice in their own skates after they are broken in otherwise you’ll fall hit your head on ice just like I said in a rental skate and kill yourself because they’re not balanced blades or custom skates and I never had been in them in my life until Tom OConnell Child, his little paid feeder and destroyer of my condo that she could have whatever she wanted including my figure skating equipment, and when I found it when my ancestor told me the phone number and I got up from my computer and I called her number and I don’t even know their last name and I asked him to go there and ask her if she had my ice skates and he told me I was crazy talking so I called her myself and she had them and she said he gave them to her when I moved out and I said oh do you have anything else from my condominium? Oh yeah we check everything and I said oh really she said he told us we could take whatever we wanted to and you can’t have them back she said they’re mine now and everything else and if you didn’t wannatake them why did you leave them? I was too scared to tell her I was in hiding, running away from him, and that Ryan couldn’t find them. They were underneath Ireland, sleigh bed, that she also check and her custom painted dresser that Sadie gave her. And she said well we don’t have to give any of it back finders keepers, losers, weepers I said those are custom ice skates I can prove in a court of law they’re mine I know where I bought them and it’s my husband teddies friend she said I don’t care who it is your brother. Tom OConnell said I could have him and his other friend his wife Tracy, I said you better mail them back to me and I gave her my address and she said no I like them you’re right you can skate better in custom skates on using them so I’m not gonna send them back and she hung up little did she know that the phone call was recorded Q has everything on her and them we are going back to our moms Jackie’s now to look at all of the signed checks Megan OConnell has been receiving support from my family’s since I received the mail in the eighth grade with a check a sizable check to go buy new ice, skates, and sweaters so I could keep up with everybody at South Mountain Arena and wear jewelry to school when I got into high school and hang out with my brother and sister, John and Caroline in private high school and you know she said I wasn’t worthy to be Jacqueline Kennedy‘s daughter and she said I’m gonna let Megan get the mail from now on you’re not allowed near the mailbox after a fight in sued for her to take the check away that my mother had written a letter and written a check made out to me so I could deposit it in South Orange in my bank account that my aunt Jane had opened in my name and she said you can’t have that money from Jane yet you’re not gonna get it until she dies and when she died it was only $1000 and since then Megan has been living in my name with my birthday and going to England and working with Tommy and Tracy and working for Jeffrey Feeney in Livingston New Jersey. I do believe I got in trouble for bad checks you’re supposed to learn something I never signed anybody else’s name that is a high class federal crime of forgery and fraud and fraudulent schemes and artifices and a whole Lotta other things and she ritualized Ireland and they ritualized orange a crime in the higher powers in government, because neither one of them understand how you go about working and serving your country in order to have an appointment from a president or a world leader, or several world leaders, or several presidents or several advisers or however, it happens, and I’m not gonna explain it, but she didn’t know, and neither did Tommy because they never sat down and had a conversation with me, and Tommy cried his way out of private school and did drugs in high school, and the drug dealers came and took his car apart so he had to have mine and went and got jobs in Arizona, and there was so much cocaine in him. Tracy had to lock them up in the bathroom and hide them so he could remove the tiles.<sep>That is a lie straight from Satan that my children do not know what a Eclipse is! All of them except Auren who was raped and tortured by the Devil himself was supposed to have me there when his grandfather died and I was scheduled to teach a classroom of students at Riker Hill Elementary School in Livingston New Jersey and Walt Motz was the principal of the school that Auren attended and his teacher was that my fathers wake at Holly funeral home and she and I were talking about how horrible this was for Auren and I said you know I wanna do something for him special and I said I don’t know what I can do. It’s like they run this place and they run his life and I want to do some thing so he’ll want to come back to school and she said well do you have any ideas and I said well we’re coming up on Halloween and a taught art at Blair academy at the Christian school that was near the campus of Blair Academy that my principal Carol Midkiff traded me tuition for Jason to attend school if I taught art and I said sure and so I had a full classroom of students, and every child got their own plastic bag with all their items to assemble their project and I told her the different things that we had done and we were talking about the classroom activities and so forth of the season and the up-and-coming holidays, and how hard that was going to be for him because my mother didn’t do anything like that she didn’t do crafts tell me and Megan didn’t do crafts and anything like that Tommy didn’t even know how to make creepy crawlers and she was too scared. He was going to get burnt so I had to make them for him and give them to him and she’d yell at me if I let him even near my hot plate and so I was talking to her about other things not him he wasn’t involved he was in another conversation I’m only bringing that up as context so she said OK what day would you like to come in and I gave her the date and she said all right well I’m gonna leave the project up to you so think about it and just come in and the kids will be happy to see you and Auren will be so excited and it’ll be great and I will see you then so I told my mother and she saw that’s nice and she verified it and we went shopping and she said what are you gonna do with all these kids and I said oh we’re gonna make glow in the dark pumpkins that hang around the outside of the costume and I need to supply all the children with their own pumpkin to assemble and then will run a string in a certain way, and they’ll hang it around their neck and everybody will see them while they’re trick-or-treating. She goes really I said yes really so she said well where are you going to buy this stuff and I said oh I don’t know so I made some phone calls and finding glow in the dark paint that was orange was not easy so we ended up in Florham Park. I’m not sure of the name of the store and we got the orange paint and we found Styrofoam white balls, Christmas balls, and we got everything else, the eyes and the lines for the ad pumpkin we’re gonna be drawn on with magic markers and we had one for each kid and we had everything that was going to go on the pumpkin and the strings that went around their necks and safety latches so they wouldn’t get hurt on the strings and they were going to attach their own latch and everything was in a plastic bag she goes you did this with Jason I didn’t know that and I said yes I thought art and she said where and I told her right next to Blair Academy. She bought everything and we had a huge bag of hundreds of dollars of craft supplies and so when we got home I said OK I’m going out in the garage and I’m going to paint the pumpkins because you can’t spray paint around little kids so I am outside and I had my grandfathers tarp down in the garage and all the garage doors open and she was on the phone with Judy Slovak the display artist for Macy’s department stores in New York and she’s telling her Telep is out in the garage Judy making glow-in-the-dark pumpkins and Judy was like oh my goodness Nancy I gotta come over and see this and I want to talk to Kathy I didn’t see her. I need to talk to her, so Judy comes over and we’re talking about this project and what I had done with Jason when he was little going to a private school and how I taught art to all these kids and she goes go to create a cheer and so I’m out there spray painting pumpkins and I don’t know how many kids it was but it was a lot of kids and the pumpkins are all drying out and Judy and I are talking and Tommy over here is it and he interrupts me as he’s picking up all the wet paint pumpkins and my grandfather pop pops tarp from Connecticut, throwing it in the garbage and screaming his head off at me”Get in the house! She is not teaching art to anyone she is delusional again and not on the right medicine and lies about everything she says about anything about herself, so I am watching him and Judy’s listening to this hello my project is in the bag from the store that we just bought it all in with the receipts and everything and he’s cleaning up the garage and throwing away the paint in the garbage cans and I’m like you can’t do that. He said if you don’t get in the house I’m calling the police. What do I do? He is a tyrant to humanity and a criminally minded person who Sensi was given a car for graduation in 1977 when I graduated the Academy of Saint Elizabeth’s has made my father Ned, feel guilty about giving me one red cent and my grandfather, Walter Wilderotter, and he has looked and lasted with TracyVanKirk after Auren OConnell since he attempted to kidnap him with babysitters, they’re called finders the babysitters were finders for Anton Lavey and the church of Satan in San Francisco, California, where these two got married legally and because they were married legally, my mother had to allow them in the house because they’re Christians and that’s the nice thing to do if you’re a Christian like they are and he just lost everything they took everything away from him and he has no right to work anywhere in the world 🌎 my father never would’ve died without a plan. The plan was when they saw Scottsdale. I was supposed to get the house when my mother died of cancer and they ruined the condo and they blamed it on me by hiring other people to tear the building apart while they were there at night, and lying to Connecticut to my aunt Pat who they said oh we’re gonna take everything she left. It looks perfectly fine and put it in the Yum Yum tree the bed-and-breakfast what is my idea and Tracy and Tommy said oh she can’t do that. She’s too mentally ill because their feeders their ideas junk even exist anymore and I was supposed to get the house in Livingston to finish raising Auren until he graduated high school and they are so jealous that he’s the only surviving OConnell that they have murdered him as a child and did rituals with him in the past to get his money 💰 and soul and he was hemorrhaging and my Mother had been tortured and raped in her bedroom and she couldn’t drive to the lawyer. I wanted her to go to Martin Castle house in Livingston, and they wouldn’t allow it and Megan came, and she drove her out of Essex County and forced her to change her agreement with my father, because that would’ve undone, Mafiosa Megan muggins shot who ritualized my daughter Ireland and murdered her inner child and subjected her to daggers being placed inside her vagina and paid other people in the neighborhood to threaten and torture my husband, David lofgren and take his house away so that I had no one she thought that Pat McKiernan, and everyone else would win. God always wins Megan and you’re not going anywhere. They murdered my husband, David, my mother, Nancy OConnell, and my father Ned O’Connell died at overdosed at overlook and I don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s out of my hands.🎉<sep>Raisins are so high in sugar I was only allowed to have them as a child instead of candy once in awhile but I had a great friend who told me mix them up with nuts 🥜 and leave them out in candy dishes instead of candy and it has always been my favorite snack and I also do not use craisins in every salad I make or eat because they are too sugary and sugar causes cancer. So I did not ever add sugar to dishes or anything except sometimes organic sugar in 1/8 teaspoons in Lemmon Tea because it upsets your stomach sometimes when you consume as many lemons as I do. But I don’t know I was given Agave to try it instead  of sugar because it is from Arizona and it is very good and a syrup but sugar is sugar and Auren is correct when I stress out I crave it in drinks with things normally I do not crave sugar or use it. My grocery bills reflect I do not even fill up my canisters in my kitchen anymore with five pounds of sugar and go buy more when it runs out. I only buy it every so often and I buy organic sugar and if I cook I do not add any sugar only tart foods or if a recipe calls for allot of sugar my Grandmother taught us all how to cut it up and figure it out how to make it with just enough sugar to enable consumption and squire less of a seeet tooth by doing things like this with yourself or your family and friends and like the food just as well because chemicals cause cancer worse and the sugar substitutes are all poisonous 🎉<sep>Daddy have faith about the future of our family and humanity and “Flying Submarines’ and this project began when we were walking our dogs Toby and Hildy and discussing the facts about our ancestors back in the 1800 era and it may seem crazy to think that submarine can fly in space but have you ever heard it actually happened when our friends the Arcuturians crashed near a secret place and time they asked if they could fly home to go to the hospital and we thought”Fly home now we will need to fix your ship first and we do not build boats we build submarines and then they informed us previously our ancestors were going to be flying submarines in the 1800s and it was primative so they did it just within the earth’s atmosphere without leaving the stratosphere and I said”Betsy remember when Tom was studying at Lowell Tech in college he put a dot on one side of a paper knapkin and a dot with a magic marker on the other side of the paper knapkin and he said “I know now how we can safely fly them home watch this you guys!” He folded the knapkin in two and he played connect the dots and he took a sharp pencil off the kitchen table and he stuck a hole straight through the two dots and said”All you need is a wormhole!”🎉❤<sep>Yes the vacume cleaner was brand new from Walmart Dirt Devil and they broke it during the onset of the pandemic so hoping I would die of nanotechnology from leaving whatever they put inside of it and they every time they came in did something to the base of my hop handle so that it rusted in a concentric circle ⭕️ surrounding the base of a brand new pole that should’ve lasted until about at least ten years and the way I stored it in my bath tub in the ringer basket of the bucket 🪣 I purchased in Home Depot when they announced on King 5 Seattle a case of coronavirus was in a nursing home in the surrounding area outside of the city 🏙️ of Seattle I canceled dancing that weekend to follow the case of the nursing homes that were dying patients from the virus leaking in a laboratory in Whuhan and somehow arriving in Seattle WA and I figured out it probably came into the port of call on a container ship that I had been lost one time and got to see the entire port of entry for containers and I used to bring container into Sea Land from Inchon South Korea and filled with knocked down residential and commercial furniture and partitions for empty square footage industrial spaces and offices through The Tri State Area territory and I managed a showroom for Borneo International Furniture in Inchon and the wood was from Borneo and I thought<sep>THE GUY THAT MAKE THESE SHORTS IS A GENIUS....<sep>JFK, Hillary and Trump got that one...raisin awareness 😅😅😅<sep>I loved Hillary&#39;s typical for Camilla<sep>All bad ! 👎 😂lol<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<sep>One has a clone.

It just feels rushed, as if you wanted this to be over with.<sep>Absolute Gold!<sep>Why such a short ending? The other episodes were like 10 minutes each<sep>This whole series are fantastic!!! All episodes had me rolling here!!! It&#39;s just too great (And it just works lol) Plz, do more content like that. More of Donald Trump in Fallout universe!

We can trust him&quot; - genius twist :)<sep>Awwwww the series was so good and the writing spot on. Hope we&#39;ll see a second season of Trump.<sep>Kinda rushed sadly. Does this mean Magaton and Joevahkin are unrelated considering RFK JR appears, even through in Joevahkin he is the likely democratic nominee for the 2024 election?<sep>Forcing everyone to eat RAD roaches! 🤣 I miss playing Fallout.<sep>Damn! Donald Jr! What a hunk!<sep>Fantastic!!!<sep>&quot;Snipers down. We can trust him&quot;. Hahahaha<sep>The faces here are way uglier unfortunately.

I kind of expected to watch Trump&#39;s adventure through the Commonwealth.<sep>Not as good as the others... and why did it end so abruptly?<sep>Fallout, one of my favorite franchises ❤<sep>Hey man, it definitely seems like you are burning yourself out. Dont be afraid to take a break, and dont worry about chasing the algorithm. Slower released content that you have passion for is much better, both as a viewer and video maker, than rushed out videos that you don&#39;t have passion for<sep>It can&#39;t end for the DON!!<sep>better than most of the marvel franchise.<sep>Obama shluld have said &quot;damn youre right, but you know what i am ok with?&quot;<br><br>Trump: what?<br><br><br>Obama: launching drone strikes even when theres children nearby (blows up both trump and donald jr).<sep>Damn shame this series was so short, it was easily your best on the channel!<sep>Thank you!<sep>That was a perfect ending, where do we get the posters of the ending slideshow!?<sep>💯 out of 💯.<sep>Alex Jones is very convincing as the leader of the Brotherhood of Steel when he&#39;s suited up in his metal armor 👍<sep>😂😂😂😂 Bravo....

But im a little disapointed that the Series ended here. I hoped to see more of Trumps adventures in the Commonwealth. What about the Institut?

Greetings from the Netherlands.<sep>Perfect<sep>Even Trump wud be puzzled seeing this, thinking &quot;When did I do this?&quot;. Rowan is toooooooo much!!<sep>Im so confused<sep>It&#39;s amazing how you never know where trump ends and mr bean begins<sep>Hilarious<sep>I am sure President Trump himself paid Mr.Bean to make videos like this! He&#39;s always tried to be the one who listens to critics!<sep>What you have to lose? My hair.<sep>That’s crazy, he sounds exactly like our former president.<sep>Ok<sep>Hilarious! Love Trump!<sep>WTF was he on about? He is insane. Good riddance!<sep>This makes me wonder, what if Mr. Bean becomes president in real or in a movie or something :D<sep>mr.bean?<sep>Excellent work.

This shows you that you can’t find anyone real in politics, hollywierd, music industry... everyone wear a mask. “The world is a stage” you’ve been deceived your entire life people.

bb1EFmt3ssg,What if Ben Kenobi Didn't Lie (Edit),What if Ben Kenobi never lied to Luke about who his father really is.  How would Luke react to that?  What other questions would Luke ask once he found out Vader was his father.  This fan edit cut the original scene in Obi-Wan's house and shows in a fun way what could of happened.  Obi Wan Remembers and tells the truth.  Audio clips are taken from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi to make this version possible.What does this clip truly show?SPOILERSSo luke ask obi wan what happened to his father.  Ben tells him that he betrayed and murdered his father...he thought he killed him but he was wrong.  Anakin became Darth Vader.Luke then ask about his mother.  Ben says 'Your mother was destroyed..well before you were born...from a certain point of view.'Then they watch the hologram of Leia.  Luke says 'shes beautiful...do you know who she is.'  Ben says 'she is  your twin sister.'  Luke gets mad and says 'ohhh thats not fair.'Then Luke ask R2 if he knew what Ben was talking about.  R2 says he always knew.  Thats when Luke loses it 'no...that can't be...THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!'SPOILERS DONE++++All this is done out of love of the movie.  No profits are made.  Original rights are owned by Lucasfilm.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1EFmt3ssg,"...yeah- this one isn&#39;t nearly as good as the MUSK one you did.

You, C3P0 were also there but you had your memory of it erased to protect their secret.&quot;<br>&quot;These blast points are too accurate for Sandpeople.

You are talented bro, you made a lot of people laugh, keep doing what you love!<sep>Yo what Is this music upon Biden entering heaven?!<sep>Jiuwaigiin? who he<sep>+1 for the dramatic intro scene of the Hunter.

Adding other non Skyrim characters and real life people really takes away what made it originally funny<sep>The Aaron Paul was so uncanny and weird.<sep>Top of the line!<sep>Hell 2.0<br>Lol 🔥<sep>What’s weird is the AI voice for Trump and Biden sound so similar in so many ways yet different. <br><br>I can’t put my finger on it. But there is some cadence or tone or something where they sound the same.<sep>Haha the part with Danny Devito growling was hilarious<sep>Next he tries to get a giant spider to kill him by wrapping him in web and drinking his fluids. The spider responds: &quot;Nah, you&#39;re  already a dried up husk.&quot;<sep>MUST HAVE SEASON 2!!!<sep>Haha goes back to the “F***king Draugr looking son of a bitch.” They think he’s one of them 😂<sep>What happened to the subtitles?<sep>LOL MANTIS!<sep>This is so funny.. 😂😂😂<sep>I look forward to this more than anything on YouTube<sep>😂😂😂<sep>Yeah, no Kennedy lol.<sep>where is subtitles??<sep>It just keeps getting better. While not the longest episode, I can tell you gave it your best with the writing and jokes in this one. I also wasn&#39;t expecting RFK Jr. to be mentioned in this. Would love to see him appear in future episodes. 👀<sep>Hunter biden 🤣🤣🤣🤣<sep>Oh, Man, This is a true masterpiece.<sep>What if Joe Biden meets Lord Harkon after accidentally finding Serana in a cave while looking for this Skooma dealer and stands in this main room of castle Volkihar full of strange people and &quot;suspicious food&quot; and dogs and he accepts the offer then becomes a vampire instead? I wonder how Biden would react to Harkon and his people dining. Hahahaha<sep>I genuinely thought, just by the title, that this was the last episode of Joevahkiin. It made me sad. Good to know this amazing series will continue. This is by far the best and funniest show I watched on YouTube for a long, long time. 😄<sep>Finally<sep>Having Danny DeVito saying “you never should have come here” was the cherry on top 😂",1

I seen one on Bloomberg last month saying something like &quot;They&#39;re all entitled but it&#39;s not just gen z, and millennials aren&#39;t working to reduce inflation&quot;.<sep>Best documentary of 2022 ! 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀<br>I hope you win the Oscar ! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<sep>The cartel Started in Los Angeles 😂, gtfo lmao<sep>ELON,get Trump to tell them;<br>YOU&#39;RE FIRED 🤠<sep>BUILDING TWITTER BACK BETTER 🤠<sep>It’s f HILARIOUS…!!! It should have been this way actually 😏<sep>Cringe.<sep>Lol😂<sep>Humor is something seriously missing these days. Many don’t know better than to not take everything so literally and so ridiculously serious.<br>These youngsters shouldn’t have had the type of hidden discriminatory control they had before Musk took over Twitter. It’s probably not unrealistic to say they had karma coming for their biased entitlement. Getting over isn’t a good way to live life. Neither is shutting down free speech just because it may not fit your limited view of reality. <br>Lesson time. <br>Bu bye kids 👋",1

Ha_Fsc3h3w4,If Luke was like Rey,"If Luke Skywalker was a Mary Sue/Gary Sue like Rey.  See a funny edit of Luke Skywalker who can easily use the force such as mind control, fix any mechanical problems, summon things with the force, and defeat his enemy Darth Vader the first time he fights him.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha_Fsc3h3w4,"I get it, rey is more skilled. But... unpopular opinion: she is better than luke as a protagonist xd. Obviously, this is just my opinion, but let me explain myself.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter how much experience or power a protagonist has, what makes them a good character is their depth. Their psychology, and make it understandable. Obviously it is necessary to see how they struggle. But that struggle must somehow change them and teach them a lesson, otherwise it would be meaningless. Luke only struggles in ep 5 and 6. Only in those two movies. In ep 4, he was basically the perfect avatar of george lucas. He has no internal weakness. No one questions his motivations or ideals. The whole movie was about him accomplishing all of his goals without making serious plot-compromising mistakes. Even the ending of the movie was sooo convenient: the last pilot (who has never flown a ship in space before) making the shot in a million and getting it on the first try despite many experienced pilots having tried it before. Luke doesn&#39;t change or struggle throughout the movie. Luckily, this changed in ep 5.<br><br>Now, Rey... yes, she is very experienced. But is that weird? Luke had two uncles who took care of him since he was a baby and gave him everything he needed. Rey grew up alone on a hostile planet where she had to learn to do a variety of things, not because she wanted to, but to survive. Context matters. And that context made her develop a weakness that made her struggle for a long time, even before ep 7: she wants a family. Wants to belong to something. That wish made her stay in jakku for a long time even though she knew how to fly ships. That desire also made her turn down a job with Han Solo, constantly wanting to return to Jakku despite the fact that she was faced with a galaxy of possibilities. Her worst mistake was rejecting Anakin&#39;s saber after it chose her. Because she then run away into the woods, basically running away from her future to return to her past, and that&#39;s where Kylo Ren kidnapped her. If it hadn&#39;t been for that serious mistake, Finn and Han Solo wouldn&#39;t have come to her rescue and Han wouldn&#39;t have died.  Rey saw this with her own eyes and understood the consequences of her actions. The consequences of not wanting to let go of her past. Therefore, when Kylo threatened Finn, she finally took the saber, accepting her future, to defend her friend. Her winning that fight was like a reward for understanding her mistakes and trying to be better. Quite the opposite of luke who did not make any serious mistakes in ep 4. It was thanks to this lesson that she decided not to return to jakku and go looking for luke skywalker, finally accepting her future and a new life for her.<br><br>This weakness is transferred to the next two films but with different approaches in each one. But the fact that Rey had internal weaknesses since the first film in her trilogy, and that she made serious mistakes that greatly altered the plot, makes her a better protagonist than Luke, who only makes serious mistakes because of his own weaknesses in eps 5 and 6.<sep>Well... luke kinda is like rey. He never flew a starfighter before the battle of yavin. He just flew a skyhopper inside the atmosphere of tatooine. Wich is an entirely different thing than flying an x-wing in a SPACE BATTLE. Not just that, he was one of the last two survivors, even when darth vader was after him, and managed to do the shot in the death star&#39;s weakness by using the force. And he didn&#39;t have any previous training in how redirect proton charges.<br><br>And his first battle against vader is completely different from Rey and Kylo&#39;s first fight. Kylo was wounded by Chewie&#39;s shot and the act of killing his father left him traumatized. In ep 7, it was made clear to us that he was tempted by light. That&#39;s why he killed his father, to suppress this temptation. But it didn&#39;t work, and in Snoke&#39;s words, the act split his spirit to the bone, leaving him more conflicted than before. That&#39;s why he couldn&#39;t use his pain to his advantage as dark force users do. The fact that he lost the fight served to make us understand how great his conflict was.<br><br>Vader in his first fight with Luke was in the best physical and mental condition. But when they fought again in ep 6, he was not like that. As much as Luke had more training, the fact that he won had nothing to do with it. Vader trained for decades, much longer than Luke. He should have destroyed him, but he didn&#39;t because the same thing happened to him that happened to Kylo: he felt temptation to the light. He did not want to harm his own son, and the conflict meant that he could not use his pain to enhance his power.<br><br>As for rey, if she had fought against kylo in his best condition, she would have lost. That&#39;s what happened in ep 9, actually. But thanks to the fact that she already knew how to fight thanks to all she learned in jakku (alone, without no one taking care of her like beru and owen took care of luke, by the way), she was able to do the basics with the saber. She didn&#39;t make any exaggerated or elegant movements like the jedi. She just block, dodge and attack. Which makes sense for a beginner like her. Finally, she used the Force to enhance her physical strength and thus defeated Kylo who was in very poor conditions. She did the same as Luke did on the Death Star: she resorted to the Force in a moment of desperation to enhance her abilities. Nothing new in star wars.<br><br>So there would be nothing wrong with luke being like rey. In fact, he is xd<sep>Yoda is like WTF?! 😳<sep>hahahahah this is great<sep>🤣🤣🤣<sep>Yeaah GaryStuewalker here !! 😂😂<sep>Luke would have trained Yoda and Obi Wan, then blown up the Death Star all by himself.<sep>Lmao<sep>There’s a wrong letter on this view count<sep>👏<sep>Time to show this to all those people who think Rey isn’t a Mary Sue but Luke is. Seriously, there are people defending Rey saying that Luke is a Gary Stu and wins everything without training. I’m showing this to Cosmonaut Variety Hour.<sep>This video is gold<sep>😂😂😂<sep>Exactly!<sep>Well, at least Luke still mentions Tosche Station and power converters, but now through a Jedi mind trick. Now just use the Force Luke to lift your lightsaber from Palpatine&#39;s throne, but let Palpatine use the Force to bonk you on the head with it. And then let him Force torture you instead of lightening.<sep>You should let luke perform the almighty force lighting like rey in TROS…<sep>Fun fact: Rey&#39;s actress had to train in lightsaber combat for months to fulfil her role, a role which didn&#39;t do any training in her whole trilogy<sep>I don&#39;t know how sloppy disney can be with their writing. Just make a character amazing at everything without any explanation, 0 development at all. Luke is a MUCH better character, anyone who thinks otherwise is either really dumb or just in denial<sep>😂😂😂<sep>Amen brother!  Well said.<sep>If Rian Johnson directed the original trilogy<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the xwing is definitely Rey.<sep>This hurts man! How can you do this to one of my favorite character?! XD<sep>Rey didn&#39;t have anyone to train her. She learned by herself without training. This film undermines her Mary Sue level.<sep>I feel so empowered watching this! Finally, Star Wars is for ME!!!! lol<sep>&quot;It&#39;s like the classic heroes journey, but you cut out all the middle stuff.&quot;<sep>I call B.S. with the wampa scene. Luke-Sue would never have gotten captured.<sep>No one mentioning about how Luke is using Force Pull in the Wampa cave, despite never having seen the power in action or teach it to him?<br><br>At least Rey saw Kylo use Suggestion and just copied it, but Luke is just a Gary Stu. ;)<sep>Cantina scene had me dying.<sep>Sadly watching this, I kept thinking how much it felt like TFA/TLJ. I think this is the type of Jedi we&#39;ll be seeing from now on: someone who inherently uses the Force without effort, without having to work to achieve power. Which, very ironically, is the basis of the pull to the Dark Side, it promises a quick and easy path to greater power. That Disney should be promoting the same mentality for both Jedi and Sith doesn&#39;t bode well for the future of the franchise.<sep><b>taps fedora furiously</b><sep>Hilarious<sep>Good meme.<sep>That was funny.<sep>Well done! Great video.<sep>LOOK AT YODAS EYES LOL",1

I would pay for this shit<sep>&quot;Omg it&#39;s a flying dinosaur!&quot;<br>He really would say that upon seeing a dragon lol<sep>It’s a flying dinosaur 😂😂😂😂<sep>MYkqOK4U<sep>Suddenly the internet got a booster shot after this wildly entertaining tale.<sep>&quot;Blue isn&#39;t really my colour.&quot; LOL<sep>BANGSAT KAU HWKWKWKW<sep>I can tell this is fake because Biden is too lucid lol<sep>&quot;Hey is that Arnold Schwarzenegger&quot; I understood the reference.<sep>Now this is quality entertainment right here!<sep>PURE GOLD!!!<sep>I lost it at “RALOF HELP!” “SWEET FUCKIN JESUS MY BACK”<sep>Lol<sep>He actually looks like Leslie Nielsen<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTMIQ1pF4&amp;t=264"">4:24</a>😂<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTMIQ1pF4&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> 🛌<sep>we don&#39;t deserve the internet<sep>The only thing more scary than cornpop is the spruce bark beetles.<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTMIQ1pF4&amp;t=306"">5:06</a> did sleepy joe just mistake a 1000-lb bear for a pet dog? 😂😅<sep>So awesome!<sep>ya allah wake up ya joe biden oom yallah<sep>It seems like you&#39;re referencing a fictional scenario that involves Joe Biden, the former President of the United States, in a video game setting. &quot;Helgen&quot; is a location in the game &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,&quot; where the player&#39;s character is present during a dragon attack and subsequent chaos.
<br>
<br>However, it&#39;s important to note that Joe Biden is a real person and not a character in a video game. The scenario you&#39;re describing is a creative and imaginative crossover between real-world politics and a video game universe.
<br>
<br>If you have any other questions or topics you&#39;d like to discuss, feel free to ask!<sep>Just wait until Joe achieves Chim on accident.<sep>Fake because Joe didn&#39;t fall when jumping off the wagon<sep>when i moved into my own first real home, these were coming out, i sat and i watched. it clensed the worry of the loneliness before i got with my woman, and if my woman ever leaves me i&#39;ll be back to binge everything. thank you for the amazing content and peaceful times.<sep>I&#39;ve just realised that these are like the precursors to some of the AI President serieses.<sep>Jió Bidn<sep>Omg when he was internally monologuing about the white house staffers acting I was legit laughing out loud<sep>“At least I can rest peacefully knowing I led the honorable life of a career politician”<br><br>Lmao!<sep>This is what deep fakes were meant for! What a time to be alive xD This is truly a defining series IMO<sep>This should be a Skyrim Mod<sep>This is the first time I&#39;ve been able to watch Joe Biden for longer than 5 seconds. You did a great job of making him actually interesting for once.<sep>Lol<sep>Didn&#39;t know Biden was a Nord.<sep>😂😂😂😂😂<sep>💪🔥<sep>Haven’t rewatched this series in a couple of weeks, time to fix that!<sep>Post your stuff on Reddit. They&#39;re linking shit without mouth<sep>LOL I&#39;m gonna need another day off to recover from watching this today🤣<sep>Is there one with trump in Skyrim<sep>&quot;You&#39;re a truly honorable man, horse thief&quot;<br>This is such a good line<sep>Knowing I’ve led the life of a career politician 😂😂😂<sep>Its very rare for me to literally laugh out loud at youtube videos, but damn i had multiple burts with this video alone. Forgetting the distraction, vengance for Corn Pop, shamefully taking gold coin from corpse, and &quot;are those giant fukn spiders?&quot; Lmao<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTMIQ1pF4&amp;t=133"">2:13</a> it&#39;s the Chinese COVID bat!<sep>This is the most cohesive I have heard Joe. And it&#39;s not even real lol<sep>weirdly enough, this makes me wanna go back and play skyrim again<sep>This is genius I am still in the middle of my first play through of Skyrim but this makes so much sense how was this done it’s so realistic and cartoony.<sep>The stairs had me dying.<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTMIQ1pF4&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> omg its a flying dinosaur. I died<sep>&quot;This ones for Corn Pop&quot; 😂<sep>this has been Joe Bidens reality for years<sep>I Need More<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTMIQ1pF4&amp;t=71"">1:11</a> well I didn&#39;t expect it to be so logical<sep>This is the best use of deepfakes I’ve ever seen<sep>joevahkiin, joevahkiin, by his presidency is sworn,
<br>To keep guns forever at bay!
<br>And his political opponents rout when they hear joe shout,
<br>joevahkiin, for your blessing we pray!<sep>Lol<sep>Biden before presidency<sep>It&#39;s pretty bad when the broken scripted voice comp is better at forming a coherent sentence.<sep>Haha. Hahaha! Please make more.<sep>CornPop was a GOOD dude. He saw Joe Biden letting children play with his leg hairs at the pool and decided to intervene as any real man would. Joe Biden abused those children at the pool that he worked at and called them cockroaches. Joe Biden is one of the biggest racists in the Democrat party. The Democrat Party is the party of historic racism. Democrats were the confederates. Abraham Lincoln was a republican. They fought a war to keep their slaves. The Democrat Party should have been banned after they lost the civil war. This time, they will.<sep>“Next, the Nord in the rags.” 😂😂😂😂<sep>Sounds more like Saul Goodman<sep>I haven’t laughed this hard at joe Biden I’m a long time<sep>Joe Biden; Arnald n word<sep>Joe-vahkiin Joe-vahkiin<br>Here comes children sniffing<sep>This is great<sep>My back!😂<sep>I can rest peacefully knowing i led the career life as a politician. -Joe<sep>This is surprisingly well made<sep>I couldn&#39;t stop watching 😭😂<sep>I think corn pop might have murdered a Vietnam vet and taken his women as sex slaves.<sep>Is he going to do a full playthrough of Skyrim as Joe Biden? This is awesome!<sep>That was epic!<sep>&quot;This ones for cornpop&quot; fuck me I&#39;m dead<sep>This is funny, but i cant stand that puppet joe biden selling out America<sep>Some will say this is fake<sep>It&#39;s about 99% light on dementia and nonsensical ramblings.<br><br>3/10",1

They are beyond terrible.!!!<sep>Freeloaders<sep>For most fucked up people in America<sep>2 pukes<sep>Leak in his sink she eat it facial hair hilarious😢<sep>SO WHEN I NO LONGER COULD TAKE THE MEDICATION SPIROLACTONE TO STOP FACIAL HAIR i WENT TO MY DERMATOLOGIST DR DANIEL FRUM WHO TREATED MY SKIN CANCER ON MY FACE AND MY BACK AND PERFORMED LAZER SURGERY AND I LIVED. HE ALSO TREATED MY HOSPITAL MRSA THAT MY SURGEON DR THOMAS TRUMBLE TRIED TO TELL MY FAMILY WOULD PROBABLY HAPPEN TO ME IF I DID NOT HAVE MY SON JASON HELP ME WITH MY WRIST SURGERY 18 Breaks in my wrist and the hospital here and Dr Guage wanted to amputate my hand and probably my arm so I walked out of the hospital against medical advice and Jason has statements about everything that they did wrong and do does Herb and they are going down now, so be it. I have made enough statements. The lawsuits and criminal charges against all of them will not go away. And i do not have enough facial hair to warrant medical intervention my dermatologist Dr Frum told me to run a mens razor on my chin where this hairline has appeared back when I went through menopause and I told him I did not want to make it get worse and he tole me I would not make it worse then it already was and I could no way afford electolosis and so what was I going to do? and It does not bother me if I is off my face and I always had a uni brow and eye brows are easy to just wax but noone here helpa me do anything about self care they feel I am spending too much money and I still have not had my toe nails cut or eye brows or hair done and I have the paperwork for Social Security to get rid of them.I was doing just fine when He did not contribute one red cent to help me out doing this and Megan hired people to help him destroy me again with them. No one is going to do or get away with that again. I hope and pray Someone else like Rick and the FBI can rescue him because it is exactly like Patty Hearst when she was free to leave she did not want to go. And they had to re program her once they got her out of it. I got him out of it from Angel because these people have no right to do what they did in the first place and they honestly do not want a war. And he went straight back to them. Stockholm Syndrome and money,<sep>I also during the time I saw Dr Rothbladt developed prolactemia and had breat milk come in and became a patient at the breast clinic at Virginia Mason Medical Center and while there they took me off the drug spirolactone because it helped cause it, and they took me off of the drug xyprexa as well it  was a lethal combination cocktail xYPEXA AND SPIROLACTONE DID THE EXACT SAME THING AS ALL AYTOICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND MY QUESTION IS &quot;WHY WHEN SOMEONE IS CLAREVOYANT AND NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG TO ANYONE OR BOUNCING ANY CHECKS OR ANY OTHER BAD BEHAVIOR DO THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TRY AND KILL ME BY FORCING A WRONG DIAGNOSIS UPON ME AND PUSHING DRUGS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIKE WHAT i SAY. WELL NOONE TELLS THEM THEY HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME. I DID NOT FORCE MYSELF UPON ANYONE HERE AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW AND WHO I HAD FUN AND GOOD TIMES WITH. AGAIN THEY SAW ME ONE MORE TIME SUCCEED AND TRY AND SABATOGE ME AND KILL MY SON AND HIS WIFE AND MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE NOT SAFE WITH THEM AT ALL. U KNOW I HAVE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN HUMAN SACRIFICE AND I DID NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY WERE AND IF THEY HAD LEFT ME AND MY CHILDREN ALONE LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WHO RESPECTED MY OWN BELIEFS AND BOUNDARIES IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. THEY DID NOT ONLY DISREPECT ME THEY KILLED ME AND MY Parents and pushed their religion upon my minor children and raped and brainwashed them and our family is done with them. I frankly have nothing further to say about it. Herb has watched this unfolding for many years and he has his ways and I do not argue with him and never have argued with him or my father Ned and Dad told me when Irelan had her accident with the tea bag that noone believed me, well that was because noone ever believed me when I always told you and them the truth because the jealousy of Tommy and Megan is so vial and the way that they paid other people to hurt kill and destroy me in many places with the help of his church of satan and do you know who Anton La Vey was Dad? You need to look at him and what he teaches and you will  begin to understand how his family and followers believe and live and it is not funny. The fact that TrACY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT SNEAKING THIS IN UNDER MY NOSE AND JASONS, WELL AND YOURS AND DOING WHAT THEY ALL DID TO MOMMY. I WAS SHCOCKED WHEN JASON CALLED OFF MARTIN. BUT HE WAS RIGHT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY DID TO HER OR AUREN AND IRELAN AND YOU NEED TO SEE THE CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE ON CAMERAS AND GO RENT THE MOVIE EYES WIDE SHUT WITH TOM CRUISE AND THIS IS THE WAY THEY LIVED. UP UNTIL NOW AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS TO US. WELL YOU CAN SEE NOW NOONE IS GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THEY FACE INCLUDING MEGAN ARE NOT UP TO ME. WHEN I HAD MY CANCER SURGERY THEY FAILED THE TEST AND REFUSED TO EVEN BE BY MY SIDE WHEN I WANTED TO DIE IN PEACE AND WELL NOW IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY THREW THAT OPPURTUNITY OUT THE WINDOW ON RYAN WHEN HE BEGGED THEM TO THE TABLE AND THEY HIRED MORE PEOPLE TO HURT ME AND PAID AUREN TO DO THE SAME THINGS BY THEATENING TO HUMAN SACRIFICE BLYTHE TO GAIN POWER OVER SOMEONE ELSE. AND THEY ADMITTED THEY HAD DONE EVERYTHING THAT I SAID THEY DID TO ME. THEY FRANKLY GAVE UP AND SAID THEY WOULD KILL AUREN OR JASON AND SO NOW HERE WE ALL ARE AT WAR WITH SATAN. I DID NOTHING WRONG. THEY HACKED INTO CHASE BANK 17 TIMES IN 7 YEARS AND I PAID THE OVERDRAFT FEES THAT THEY CREATED TRYING TO DISQUALIFY ME INFRONT OF ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING BOTH SIDES NOW SINCE THEY KILLED MOMMY AND REFUSED TO LET ME GO <a href=""http://home.no/"">HOME.NO</a> LONGER WILL THEY SEE ME OR MY SONS OR DAUGHTER OR GRANDCHILDREN OR ANYONE WITH BLACKBERRY. I AM HERE FOR YOU AND JUST LIKE ME YOU ARE PROBABLY IN SHOCK FROM THIS WE ALL ARE DAD,<sep>As far as facial hair is concerned I have a hormone imbalance that was discovered at Virginia Mason by Dr Rothbladt my gynecologist when I had cervical cancer and he placed me on spirolactone and at the time I only had a slight hairline on my chin and I was trying to prevent it from becoming worse and he told me the drug would prevent it. Well I was taking xyprexa because everyone else was pressuring me into bipolar and Granite was listening to what their narrative was and the fact that I continued to drink wine and was not really using it every day but when I did drink it I self medicated the pain of the years of abuse and never spoke badly about anyone of them or felt anything was wrong because they had conditioned me into believing this was what my parents wanted for me so what could I possible hacw done except wait for the possibility for Jason to see it himself. So I prayed for that to happen and ut did<sep>I have certainly said that I am on a seafood diet in the past after I had tried to explain intermittent fasting and ordered the book to try to explain to someone it would help them with their addiction to sugar and sugar additives such as other sweetners and they justified the artificial sweeteners with the same statement as regular consumtion of what I think is too much sugar and I am going by the principle we really need to be free entirely of it if possible for the healing of cancer. i am not judging anyone but every single time i would observe them gorging themselves with candy they justified it by saying &quot; When I am ready I will quit it and until then do not tell me what to do when I want to eat it.&quot; I explained to her that &quot; Did you ever think that when you walk out of the store with candy bars and soda to drink and eat on the way to Silverdale that your choices eating it infront of me in my car while I am driving makes it difficult on me then to keep away from what you are consuming? She told me if I did not like it too bad it was her body and I could do whatever I wanted and so could she. And she does not understand what it was you all were trying to help me with. Every single time I went to improove upon myself from really good healthy directives from your years of knowledge to help me stay cancer free and loose weight she would tear me down and then proceed to continue to tell me that I was being used by everyone and that she would never work for free, and when I attempted to explain what it was I was doing when I was called up by the Military and members of my own family without mentioning or name dropping anyone else she told me,&quot; Carl says your crazy and I am not listening to you anymore anyway because you do not know what you are doing, and everything you tell me and everyone else never happens and he says things that are totally different to me then you do. I am going to listen to Liz because she knows what she is doing, and you do not. So I said,&quot; Ok go listen to Liz and I hope you both have a nice life because I tried with both of you, and I am moving forward now with my own family.&quot;<sep>Leak in his head<sep>THESE PEOPLE ARE SINNERS AND NEED TO REPENT AND OBEY ACTS 2 38 AND JOHN 3 5 AND UNLESS YOU REPENT YOU WILL DIE IN YOUR SINS JESUS CHRIST ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Sell out where the email why is Obama keep having men drop dead.<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂<sep>They are all pure evil!<sep>I enjoy listening to all these different people talk foolish.<br>It&#39;s fun with NO harm to anyone😮<sep>我聽不懂英文請翻譯給我不然我不理妳們😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅<sep>I love these people but this funny 🤣🤣 🤣<sep>😂😂😂<sep>Both terrible<sep>Is this real<sep>Lmao these make me laugh so much.

Dont ask me how I know ... :x<sep>But if no one can hear you say the n-word, then what&#39;s the point?<sep>This is wildly underrated<sep>mid game<sep>Man in space &quot;finally i can say the n-word.............&quot;<sep>LMFAO<sep>Need a woodchipper to throw nazis into<sep>Xcellent!<sep>There must be a mod someday which gives Elon Musk as a  companion!<sep>I was wondering what your Starfield series would be 😂<sep>🤣🤣🤣<sep>In space nobody can hear you say the N-word.<sep>If Elon Musk is in Starfield, so is Planet Mountain Dew.<sep>Im genuinly disappointed. 😂<sep>Ai is the shit! hahah<sep>I really like Elon Musk, and found this hilarious.<sep><del>rocket</del> star ship science is hard<sep>Was that a Kinzhal?<sep>Poochie was killed on the way to his home planet.<sep>He&#39;s a weird dude but he may be our best chance of actually getting to Mars.<sep>even Elon can&#39;t fix this dogshit Creation Engine<sep>In the year 2330, Elon Musk has finally bought Youtube.<br>It has been renamed to XVideos.<sep>No one can hear you say the n-word in space, because sound doesn&#39;t travel in a space.<sep>👍👍🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣✅🤣🤣<sep>But Liberals love the N-word, its in all the songs they listen to while their wives are hanging out with their wives&#39; boyfriends.<sep>All the gaming YouTubers reviewing the game while the good Dr bringing the medicine we really want ❤<sep>“*Flirt*… say the N-word”<sep>We didn&#39;t even get to know his pronoun<sep>To be honest, I would want someone like Elon to lead an outworld colony, instead of some old corrupt politician @ssholes.<sep>Starfield sucks but your videos are top notch <a href=""UCo5nE1xrHBkUcIPf7Dxgt_w/XxcoZNfIIrmF6dsP7bmMuA0""></a><sep>top notch<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qXGCo0YAJg&amp;t=9"">0:09</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bantheadl"">#BanTheADL</a><sep>And they all died during liftoff!🤣<sep>This voice model you used to generate this is incredible.<sep>All I hear from Elon is &quot;Brand X Brand X&quot;<sep>todd howard should&#39;ve behind elon musk<sep>I am just patiently waiting for Manslayer’s work on this game.<sep>I want to see all dialogue options<sep>dude when r the longer vids coming back!! i want the next chapter of jordan peterson in black mesa!<sep>Musk in Starfield Vs. Howard in Oblivion. Tough choice...🤔<sep>Real talk, it&#39;s horrifying that people automatically associate free speech with &quot;saying the n word&quot; and mock it, i don&#39;t think westerners know how tyrannical and corrupt it can get if people start getting censored<sep>Bet Someone will add a Elon companion mod<sep>It’s official Elon musk is cannon well… he was after that explosion<sep>This is fake right? Please tell me it&#39;s fake<sep>Can&#39;t wait for modders to make an Elon Musk companion mod<sep>Lol, I really wished Bethesda would of added Elon Musk as a NPC Easter egg somewhere on a outpost on Mars. Elon gets along very well with Todd Howard, so this definitely should of been a possibility. 😊😊 BTW this video simply deserves a million views!<sep>I knew it! 😃 ... The second they took off I thought to myself &quot;If Dr. Phoxotic isn&#39;t a Musk simp, he&#39;s going to make this ship blowup before it fully takes off.&quot; Well done.<sep>What are your character&#39;s pro-nouns?<sep>&quot;Depends.

For humanity. For my own life. Just kidding, my life is hopeless.<sep>AI is a beautiful thing<sep>I kinda expect this from Dr Phoxotic but still can&#39;t believe it will be this soon. You are single-handedly making these Bethesda games better!<sep>No<sep>Joe Biden in Skyrim, Trump in Fallout, now Elon in Starfield. The unholy trinity<sep>I knew darn-well it would explode. It&#39;s what happened to a few of Elon&#39;s rockets, anyway.<sep>Top tier<sep>If nobody can hear you say the N-word in space, then what&#39;s the point?<sep>Since there is a Mantis Armor set in Starfield, we need an appearance from Mantis Tobbogin.<sep>Unironically,  this has better facial animation than the actual starfield<sep>This is my new favorite video! 😂💀🔥<sep>Facial expressions are on point with a bethesda game<sep>When he said liftoff....I felt that<sep>Protagonist: Give me the N-w0rd pass, Elon.<br>Elon: B-but, why.<br>Protagonist: [Persuade] My objectives are beyond your understanding.<br><b>Success</b><sep>better dialogue than the actual game<sep>&quot;In space nobody hears you say the N-word!&quot; xDDD I love you, Doc! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nohomo"">#NoHomo</a> 😙<a href=""UCo5nE1xrHBkUcIPf7Dxgt_w/XxcoZMzJIrmF6dsP7bmMuA0""></a><sep>And he just needs a few billion more dollars to get us to Mars.<sep>It’s a buggy mess with really poor writing, does have better gunplay than their last Bethesda game though.

Please release the full version song joe is dancing please 😢<sep>Joe biden😅😅😅😅<sep>When the guy said that the US president had to undergo a simple IQ exam, I knew it Joe was gonna screw it up really bad 😅😂<sep>Jordan Peterson does not administer IQ tests, and there is no such thing as a &quot;Furry disease.&quot; Additionally, it&#39;s important to approach discussions about individuals and their abilities with respect and accuracy.
<br>
<br>Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology, known for his views on various subjects including psychology, politics, and philosophy. IQ tests are tools used to measure cognitive abilities and are not administered or &quot;passed&quot; in the same way as a traditional test.<sep>I think Lydia is just too old for creepy Joe<sep>&quot; I&#39;d like to spend them...... banging you&quot; OMG!🤣<sep>&quot;Whyte howse mAn&quot; sounds about right for him.<sep>Joe&#39;s IQ is immeasurable.

You are a genius, my friend<sep>These are brilliant.  But the only thing leaving Biden unconvincing as a character in these, is the fact that he doesn&#39;t fall over often enough.<sep>&quot;I always liked snow, it reminds me of mayonnaise.&quot;<sep>Where part 10? :(<sep>Do you think Biden understands in real life he is in some sort of important position in White house?

I hate this more than anything I’ve ever seen 😭<sep>Are we sure the mage in Whiterun said he would turn into a werebear? The court mage of whiterun was always super sketchy, it was probably a bad translation. He is probably going to turn into a giant Carebear.<br>Plus to Nord warriors a giant passive pink or purple monstrosity, would probably scare the ever living soverngard out of them.<sep>This is honestly one of the best series that has been made on youtube in years, there&#39;s never anymore original content, this is a nice reminder of when Youtube had actually entertaining original content.<sep>LMAO! 🤣<sep>Brilliant series would love more episodes!<sep>Biden is so lame, because the reaility is so much more gross than you could depict it here.<sep>Thanks!<sep>Should of said at the end: if you don&#39;t subscribe, you&#39;re not red guard.<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Qjah7C7Qs&amp;t=504"">08:24</a> genius.<sep>Has Joe Biden seen this?

FdV5lTtx5C8,Insane Lip Sync and Dubbing | Vision Dub,"Insane Hyper Realistic Lip Sync Video Dubbing.""Seeing is no longer believing in this era of AI.” This line, though never actually spoken by Shah Rukh Khan, underscores a reality in today’s tech-driven world.🌐 Beyond just high resolution voice cloning and lip-syncing, we’ve translated the message into several languages, including Sanskrit, Korean, Tamil, Kannada, and more. This aspect demonstrates the vast potential of AI in breaking down language barriers and enhancing global communication.🤔 The reality we’re showcasing is double-edged: while AI can create immersive and diverse content, it also poses significant challenges in terms of the authenticity of information. This technology can be beneficial, such as in movie audio dubbing and personalized content, but its potential for misuse is something we cannot ignore.🌟 Our goal is to ignite a discussion on the ethical implications of AI in media. We believe that the only way to prepare for a future where such technology is commonplace is through awareness and informed public discourse.💬 We invite you to engage in this crucial conversation. What are your thoughts on the use of AI in media?

Cena knew about the grate, chose Shatner because he&#39;s a bad shot, and his plan involved sneaking to the enemy leader&#39;s camp. It&#39;s subtle but it&#39;s there. Also Cena standing, CLEARLY VISIBLE, attracting the orcs&#39; attention to it.<sep>Bro all of William Shatner&#39;s lines in this were gold, as was Leonard Nimoy&#39;s timeless advice.<sep>Please tell me what do you use to make these hilarious videos! 😂<sep>I expected a video of Cena speaking fluent orcish and telling Saruman&#39;s army how much he loves and respects them... while wearing a skirt.<sep>Need a John Cena LOTR crossover now!!<sep>we definitely need a william shatner series, some boston legal shit or something idk, or walking around talking shit about people.<br>hes a legend<sep>That was really good with Cena and very funny.<sep>&quot;Will, if you ever find yourself at the Battle of Helm&#39;s Deep, make the fucking shot.&quot;<sep>Which game is used at the back ground?<sep>This is canon<sep>FUck<br><br>yes!<sep>I literally only realised yesterday that the Uruk-hai are named after the armies of Uruk who basically set out to conquer Mesopotamia in the first ever known invasion in history.<sep>Does anyone else feel like its more natural for cena speak in chinese at this point ?<sep>Amazingggggg<sep>Where was John Cena, misleading title unsubscribed :(<sep>In real life, John Cena would side with the Orcs<sep>Cena: * Aggressively Puts on Skirt *<sep>i hit him 🤣🤣 Good Work bro<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRejC5N3wCU&amp;t=13"">0:13</a> why the fuck am I seeing him?<sep>There are few things in this current world which make me extremely happy.

I watched the whole 3 minutes and 25 seconds and I did not see John Cena.<sep>Shatner😂😂needs a right good bating<sep>This battle was lost due to the general&#39;s incompetence, not the soldier&#39;s<sep>Ok I get why John Cena is in this, but why Shattner? This is so random, it adds another layer of insanity<sep>Man, I was hoping you&#39;d go for Chong Xena betraying the siege by changing sides, speaking Orkish and eating mud-flavored ice cream to impress Saruman.<sep>Lol 😂 😂 people actually paying just to get noticed<sep>A brave son of Zhōngguó has fallen today, Xhao Xina.

I mean I would watch it, god... I might even pay for it! This would be lit TWD &amp; Breaking Bad joint as Tv series!

As long as I&#39;ve lived - I haven&#39;t had the interest nor need to bother with what it is or how it works. Until recently a big, almost decade-long maintained table of Sony sensor data disappeared from an article. I thought it&#39;s some trolls that wanted to mess up a niche article since there&#39;d probably be no repercussions(I mean, it&#39;s not like they were removing ukrainian propaganda), and they quoted some nonsensical wiki rules that, I assumed, are like &quot;baby goes potty&quot; menial stuff for &quot;extremely&quot; clueless editors, and I assumed that the trolls tried to misinterpret or abuse those rules.<br>So I appealed to authority and common sense and... turns out those weren&#39;t trolls, they were diligent editors of wiki and they were doing a PUBLIC SERVICE. <br>And, to quote these &quot;servicemen&quot;: &quot;Useful is not a criterion&quot;(gee, what an encyclopedia) and &quot;I won&#39;t wait until 2032 for a response&quot;(about discussing the deletion of the material, and that&#39;s after the first &quot;serviceman&quot; deleted it without even asking and some desperados tried to undo it and the article got locked by british admins twice).<br>Every attempt to reason, to explain that not only is that list not a new thing and it is pretty much the ONLY such list on the ENTIRE internet, that it was updated by DOZENS of people over the years for that precise reason that wiki is accessible and... right out there, and every request to keep it(and there were at least 5 people speaking up) - was returned with links to essays on what wiki is not and that the information should be moved to some podunk subwiki, because it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;fancruft&quot;, &quot;wiki is a not a web host&quot; etc.<br><br>Read: An encyclopedia... that does not have &quot;usefulness&quot; as a criterion for its material. And a &quot;community-built online resource&quot; that is &quot;not a web host&quot; and has a term for &quot;fancruft&quot;.<br>I thought that 2022 couldn&#39;t get any worse. But it did. Right on the day of Christmas(well, technically the assault of the article first began in November).<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23modernsociety"">#ModernSociety</a><sep>what&#39;s even funnier, is that BB and TWD are the same universe fun fact.<sep>This is damn near movie quality.

Sending so you don&#39;t do any more ads 😛<sep>DEAR PUTIN AND PATRIOT RUSSIANS BEWARE OF THE FREEMASONS THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOUR SATELLITES(occult ones)///

More more. ❤<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tE7jHXC3c8&amp;t=405"">6:45</a> xD<sep>My cameo was awesome!<sep>damn these are awesome<sep>😂<sep>На пятой минуте орнула жеско<sep>Is that the Lusty Argonian Maid?<sep>Once again, it&#39;s important to clarify that Joe Biden is a real-world political figure and not a character in the video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.&quot; Any scenarios involving him in the context of the game are fictional and imaginative.
<br>
<br>In Skyrim, characters can experience simulated effects of alcohol, such as becoming &quot;drunk&quot; or suffering from a hangover, as part of the game&#39;s mechanics. However, this is purely a gameplay element and not something that can be applied to real-world individuals.<sep>Fiction becomes reality!<sep>Man, adding Putin to this made it twice as funny in my opinion. 😆😂🤣<sep>The amount of clever bits in these is insane. I swear to god this shit is being downbosted; it should have so many more views<sep>It took me way too long to realize that putin was actually just speaking english... Fml<sep>I see that the latest one is &#39;Joe Biden Dies in Skyrim.&#39;<br><br>... A bit of a missed opportunity if it doesn&#39;t go this way or at least include some elements of this...<br><br>&quot;Oh no,  oh I think this is it, I&#39;m goin&#39;... oh I&#39;m goin&#39; to that great ice cream shop in the sky... ohhhh, Corn Pop? Corn Pop, are you there? Aw c&#39;mon man, you managed to keep the chain? Bad dude... wait... Corn Pop? But... am I going... WHERE am I going? Where am I? What&#39;s happening, I tell people I&#39;m Catholic but is God really real? Is HELL real? Oh no... no, no, no, is it too late to make up for it all, already?&quot;<br><br>This sucks, honestly I had something in mind that I found REALLY clever and funny, but while writing that dialogue I forgot. The joke was going to be delivered in the dialogue but I tried to write it in a believable manner that had references so I was thinking about various things and I also had a toke not long ago which doesn&#39;t help my short-term memory at all, in fact it actively hinders it at least in the short term though I think I tend to ultimately remember what happened when I was stoned after I come down from it, even if at the time it can be like &quot;Wait, what was I just talking about? What was my point?&quot; So annoying...<br><br>Anyhow yeah, sadly I think I completely forgot what my MAIN joke was, and I REALLY feel like it was a darn clever one and I tend to be good at wordplay. Unfortunate, but such is life, maybe in future I should remember to write a few words to summarize the general concept before then hitting Enter twice, writing everything, then going to the beginning and just backspacing a few times for a few words in a sentence or tiny paragraph summary will just get rid of that faff and you&#39;ve got your eloquent joke that you actually REMEMBERED! Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?<br><br>Disappointing... HAH, so not only do I think it&#39;d be disappointing to NOT have that joke I thought of in the video, but if it&#39;s not in the video then... hahaha at least I won&#39;t remember what I&#39;m disappointed at not being included in a missed opportunity! lmao<br><br>Reminds me of that scene in Mad Men... because I caught onto that. &quot;did he write it down?&quot; He didn&#39;t say it, he wasn&#39;t seen writing it down, and he was drunk I think and/or in the process of drinking... did he write it down? Did he? If not, will he remember?<br><br>No he didn&#39;t write it down when he had that idea that virtually had him DANCING with the anticipation of great success with said idea, and no he couldn&#39;t remember it. He even asked people he spoke to that night I think but none can recall him mentioning some great idea he had that he was celebrating about.<br><br>Kinda heartbreaking... but that happens in life. C&#39;est la vie, ribbit, pardon I think I had gotten something stuck in my throat there. Hopefully I don&#39;t get hauled before an EU council of ethics and hate speech for it. And how would the council like to be greeted? A wave, or the straight-armed allegedly Italian-originated salute to the direction the GENERAL EU has in my view been taking while they HYPOCRITICALLY call the new female Italian leader (first for the country, apparently, with her title and being female with it) a fascist, while themselves acting very recklessly and with lots of identity politics and attempted censorship of the internet for... A DECADE OR CLOSE TO IT! Well the internet censorship, a bit more recent, but WOW the EU and specifically Germany has just been BENDING OVER to virtue signal and put their people at risk for the sake of helping illegal immigrants.<br><br>Because I mean, hey, ask  the Democrats... leftists LOVE a nice faithful left-voting Black voting block, amirite? Even if it leads to maybe more crime and unemployment (potentially even as much as double in some cases)? Though at least they&#39;re accomplishing that out of a show or virtue-signalling, instead of America&#39;s at-the-time quite normal act of bringing in THEIR diverse Democrat-voting block to some degree via slavery. So there&#39;s that... it&#39;s not slavery... though if it goes like America then well Europeans can deal with instances like the New Years thing in Germany in 2015/16 I think it was, AND I guess in 404 years (if we went by the 1619 year that leftists like) then they&#39;ll be experiencing 2x as much crime as they otherwise would be with... well y&#39;know, violence-encouraging music and gang violence and graffiti and bad dress habits and weird slang in whatever language that European country speaks, etc. Well specifically I think I was speaking of Germany so yeah gonna be some fresh new German slang coming in centuries to come from the 2015 Migrant Crisis.<br><br>Totally worth all the sexual assault and mess and terrorism, amirite? And if it goes like America, future leftist political victories will be WAY easier! WOW! Clearly if it goes like it went with America and slavery, NOTHING bad will happen with their New Germans and New Swedes and New French and New Spanish and New Portuguese (wait they refuse to give handouts so even when PAID to let them in, they tended to just leave anyway and once more become the problem of European countries that give money) and New Poles (wait, nope) and New Finns and new Hungarians (wait, they were smart too and used a fence, which is a form of wall), etc. Well y&#39;know, other than would have happened ANYWAYS by locals...<br><br>Fuck, and even while for SOME reason wasting my time arguing with a leftist online, said that 1st generation immigrants tend to commit criminal acts in his country LESS than local-born people on average but their offspring happens to commit more crime than they do! &quot;If anything it doesn&#39;t mean immigrants cause violence, it just means they&#39;re bad parents.&quot; That&#39;s not my quote lmao The leftist I was talking to said that, oof, if they were debating Trump he&#39;d have ABSOLUTELY torn that dummy to pieces for saying something like that, especially in a presidental debate? That&#39;s it, that line is a candidacy-killer... and &quot;If you think of voting for the other guy then you ain&#39;t Black&quot; should REALLY have been a presidential killer, but something tells me CNN wouldn&#39;t air constantly unless a Republican says it. Democrat? Nah, they don&#39;t speak of that, they don&#39;t self-criticize or criticize their own side at least from what I&#39;ve seen UNLIKE FOX NEWS  who I have seen criticize and press Republican politicians and while I don&#39;t recall anything specific I&#39;ve no doubt someone in Fox News staff has addressed that something they said was factually incorrect without knowing it was incorrect but finding out and so correcting themselves. And CNN probably does that too from time to time with their reporting, possibly at times &#39;not so accidental&#39; and just wanting to get that big news piece out there for people to read and then hopefully NOT see the update, being left with the incorrect info, and if that happened even once then that is manipulative propaganda.<br><br>Such is the difference between a mistake and a lie. A lie has intent, and a mistake is by accident and/or due to ignorance. It&#39;s like me saying &quot;I believe that the average size of an elephas maximum indicus of Malaysia (Asian elephant, if I spelled that Latin correctly, even a 2-second timespan can be difficult to memorize three foreign words) penis is 10 inches.&quot; Now that&#39;s not my TRUE believe, it is not a statement that I hold to be true, but if I had to just... throw out a guess of the average penis length of the Asian elephant I&#39;d guess 10&quot; which is about 25cm.  But I haven&#39;t checked to confirm, and indeed it likely is not exactly 10&quot; which means if I said that as a statement of fact in ignorance with ZERO proof, I am LIKELY lying, or I&#39;m being REALLY darn lucky... as are the Asian elephants... oh wait they&#39;re more than twice as big as humans... uh... well, from the HUMAN perspective if Malaysian elephants have an average length of THAT, then they&#39;re lucky from THAT perspective, but possibly not from the perspective of the female Asian elephants... which is what they&#39;re called in Wikipedia by the way so I guess is the more common name than that Latin I fished up for yucks... and I haven&#39;t done research to see if I can find out how because I didn&#39;t want to fee-... I didn&#39;t want to make the men of Malaysia feel jealous if they HAPPEN to not have ten inch wangs... uh... I guess that must suck?<sep>&quot;put down the crack pipe, its my turn!&quot; lmfao what a line<sep>shyfirisghu<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tE7jHXC3c8&amp;t=405"">6:45</a> , man,  you got me there.<sep>Played the stock market better then Ronaldo playing football<sep>I never said good luck.<sep>Poor Lifts-Her-Tail.

Darth Trump was a Dark Lord of the Republican Party, so tremendous and so wise he could use the executive branch to influence the taxpayers to create walls… He had such a knowledge of the conservative side that he could even keep the ones who supported him from fact-checking his statements. The right side of the political spectrum is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his Political power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his Supporters everything he knew, then his Supporters shocked him by Rebelling . Ironic. He could save others from theocracy, but not himself.<sep>For a video that&#39;s not a political statement, it&#39;s very topical and on point.

It's been eight years since the alien-seeking presidents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. And now it's a race against the clock as Barry must convince Joe-who not only has absolutely no memory of his time spent with the Men In Black, but also has no memory of his blond leg hairs. Whether we like it or not, he is the only living person left with the expertise to save Democracy and-to reunite with the MIB before the earth submits to ultimate destruction.This video is entirely parody.

Still did though.<sep>Bethesda games are all the same. This literally feels like the parthunaax dilemma but at least there is an option, albeit a crappy one.<sep>Everyone who killed Danse. Play Soma. And seethe. Spoilers: In that game, there is only 1 human who <i>isn&#39;t</i> a robot clone, and she&#39;s <i>begging</i> for death.<sep>I love the BoS in this game<sep>he&#39;s a robot lmao just shoot the tin can LOOOOL<sep>Can you shoot the officer instead?<sep>I love the Mitchell and web look<sep>Me to Danse<br>&quot;Nothing personal kid&quot;<br>Blamo<sep>for this reason alone is why I do not side with the brotherhood when playing fallout 4<sep>Paladin Danse died well. In my game I shed a tear as i did what he asked then went outside and fired a ceremonial laser gun salute. Nothing in the game moved me his commitment did.<sep>What’s the depressing music in the background?<sep>Please make Prestons settlement missions into a Sir Digby Chicken Caesar skit<sep>I find it really funny that my Fallout 3 character (proud and faithful member of the BoS) and my Fallout 4 character (proud agent of the Railroad) would kill each other on sight.<sep>&quot;But our power armour helmets has skulls on them&quot;<sep>No.<sep>Brotherhood originally was never good guy to begin with....they horded techs for themselves and does not share with anyone in the wasteland...they will get those tech by force if they have to....also racist toward every others races as you see here (despite Synth gen 4 in Fallout 4 is no less than human with cyborg enhance). so yeah...Brotherhood ARE the baddies in some cases...but only apply to this chapter in commonwealth. there are some good brotherhood chapter somewhere in the wasteland.<sep><b>“Noh, we’re in a terribly written game, Mark.”</b><sep>If they can be ordered to shutdown with a simple command, it&#39;s not far from the imagination that they can be made to do other shit just as easily, that means whatever morals, friendships, love etc. they were programmed with or developed in time it can be taken away in an instant. The fact that they are made by killing people and harvesting their memories doesn&#39;t help either. No suprise that the Big MT crew and mr. House decided to turn to life extending tech instead of programming an AI with all of their memories, they knew that this copy would just be a poor imitation of a real living being.<sep>cheap edit and predicatable, dont waste your time on this channel, hit not interested and give a thumbs down<sep>I kid you not when I say this, but the first time I had this scene, in the middle of the dialogue a Mythic Deathclaw stormed in and killed both of them pretty much instantly.<br>Don&#39;t know if it was there because of some mod, but it was funny as hell. Thank god for quicksaves.<sep>i still don&#39;t understand the point, aren&#39;t BOS main goal is to reclaim hostile technology? not destroying it, killing danse is the equivalent of blowing up power armor, it doesnt make sense.<sep>&quot;You simply should not exist&quot; what, and your floating fortress, laser weapons, nuclear energy fuelled man-shaped tanks and pharmaceuticals that heal broken bones SHOULD? Even if he deems synths to be machines, he never elaborates on what&#39;s so abominable about them. Shouldn&#39;t they just be categorised as human-like [machines]? <br><br>Sure, they&#39;re mostly under institute control. So study them. Find how, exactly, the institute is controlling the synths. Interrogate, experiment; find out what the synths are willing to do and not do. What they&#39;ll tell you, teach you. The Brotherhood should want to find out if Synths can be an asset. If they&#39;re so human like as to be such a threat, to be so abominable, why doesn&#39;t the Brotherhood attempt to use these human-like qualities? The kill on-site rule makes no sense to me. <br><br>1. They&#39;re machines, machines can be tamed and used.<br>2. Or they&#39;re synthetic people, people can be an asset. There&#39;s nuance in people. <br><br>I wish they&#39;d had Maxon really explain what the deal is. Always felt like it was written off as &quot;our science/engineering? Good! Anything better than our science/engineering? Affront to nature, exterminate!&quot; Even with ghouls in previous titles, SURELY the best course is to attempt to understand the ghoul condition and the role of ghouls in the wasteland. What even is the end goal of the Brotherhood? I haven&#39;t played the older games excluding a bit of NV and FO3; I understand that they&#39;re a splinter of the Enclave which was a splinter of the remains of the US government? That&#39;s a question because I don&#39;t actually know. <br><br>In FO4 it only ever seems to be &quot;We hate technology (not our technology) because... uh, it bad? God or something? Idk, go kill some synths thanks&quot;.<sep>W the Institute ❤️<sep>The worse part about this mission has to be the fact that there WAS an alternate option for Danse to come out on top, the cut final part of the mission where Danse has the option to challenge Maxson for the title of Elder, and probably change the Brotherhood for the better. Bethesda cut it because it seems like they wanted this choice for Danse to not have a happy ending no matter what.<sep>&gt;not siding with the Minutemen and getting to hang out with Danse forever<sep>Lmao, I never explored Danse&#39;s Quest so I completed the whole game with him thinking he was human, he even fought by my side against the synths 🤣<sep>Such a great line from Mitchell and Webb for this part of the game, id die to see David Mitchell be a FO voice actor<sep>There it is, the last Vertibird out of Saigon.<sep>I think I missed something with Danse, if this is at all true.<br>I just didn&#39;t care about him or BOS.<br> Hancock and Nick all the way oops<sep>That’s my husband Maxxson. Fuck off<sep>Waffen SS?<sep>this is why i lit the prydwen tf up right before i knew i’d have to make that decision on my second or third playthrough. it made danse hate me, but at least he’s alive.<sep>The problem with the railroad is their pathological altruism where they show more kinship with fake people than with real people. That&#39;d be like me getting cross with you because you insulted siri, Come on man, use your brain. I killed Danse in this scene, not because I was forced to, or because I didn&#39;t care about him, but because it is what needed to be done.<sep>Skyrim player: Paarthurnax flashback<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂<sep>The Brotherhood in F4 were just the diet Enclave. But Bethesda isn’t nearly based enough to have made the Enclave a major faction and not include the Brotherhood. Oh, and the other three factions are shit too.<sep>Maxson: I can&#39;t believe Danse was a synth...<br><br>Sole Survivor: I mean, all the Brotherhood are kinda robots if they believe the BS you&#39;re shoveling.<br><br>Maxson: WHAT WAS THAT?<br><br>Sole Survivor: Nothing... Fascist.<sep>Danse really does make it out the worst. He either dies or finds out he&#39;s everything he was told to hate. There is no happy ending for the Paladin.<sep>Lol, really the only &quot;good guy&quot; faction is the Minutemen. Even then, their missions felt very flat and one dimensional.<sep>easiest choice of my life i hate those robots<sep>We saw danse in fallout 3 as a kid, he doesn’t deserve that end<sep>The complicated thing is that the synths in fallout 4 are created unaturally, and ungodly in a sense.<sep>hahaahahhahaha this is good btw what did paladain Danse do?<sep>no baddies ! you do what needs to be done !<sep>Dying 🤣🤣🤣<sep>Man that moment in the game actually caught me off guard i wish i could just save the guy<sep>Does anyone know the exact song that plays at the end? The one with piano intro.<sep>Always have been. <b>Holds up plasma pistol</b><sep>forget moral ambiguity all my homies use obvious morality<sep>I&#39;d like to thank this video&#39;s sponsor The Enclave<sep>Do you do poison?",1
