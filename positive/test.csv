KvWL3zsR8p0,"Transforming AI real time Translation with Voice Cloning in 117 Languages 🎤""","🚀Recently, Prime Minister Modi utilized an AI tool for language translation in his speech in Varanasi.Inspired by this, we’ve taken a leap forward with our own innovation: VisionDub. 🌐(THERE WAS A GLITCH in the existing tool used by modi ji: the translated voice is not of modi's but some other avatar voice and the language limitation is 12 languages only). We at vision dub solved this problem by creating a groundbreaking ai tool. 🚀 Introducing VisionDub: The Future of AI-Powered Communication 🚀Welcome to a world where language barriers are a thing of the past! Our latest innovation, VisionDub, is here to revolutionize the way we communicate across different languages.🔊 What's VisionDub?VisionDub is a cutting-edge AI tool that does more than just translate; it clones the speaker's voice in real-time, delivering translations in an astonishing array of 117 languages, including regional Indian languages like Sanskrit, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, and international languages like Korean.👤 Why VisionDub?Inspired by Prime Minister Modi's use of AI for translation, we recognized a crucial missing piece: the personal touch of the speaker's own voice. VisionDub fills this gap, providing a more authentic and engaging communication experience.🌐 See It in Action!In this demo, witness the seamless integration of translation and voice cloning. From a speech in Hindi to its translation in multiple languages, hear how VisionDub maintains the speaker's unique voice, making the message more personal and impactful.🔍 Features & Benefits:Real-time translation and voice cloningSupports 117 languages, including numerous Indian and foreign languagesEnhances the clarity and impact of cross-lingual communicationIdeal for public speaking, international conferences, and more👏 Join Us in Breaking Language BarriersWatch our demo and see how VisionDub is not just about technology; it's about connecting people, cultures, and ideas.

That&#39;s exactly what the US does.<sep>The oblivion crises?<br>Ulfrik!<sep>i love joe&#39;s democracy<sep>Joe is starting to know how to play &quot;the game of thrones of Skyrim&quot;.<sep>Certainly! In a creative and fictional scenario, if Joe Biden were to somehow find himself in the world of &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,&quot; he might endeavor to bring elements of democracy to the region. Here&#39;s how it could play out:
<br>
<br>After arriving in Skyrim, Joe Biden, known for his advocacy of democratic principles, could become an influential figure among the people of Skyrim. Recognizing the feudal and monarchic system that currently exists in the land, he might work to introduce concepts of representation, civic participation, and individual rights.
<br>
<br>Here&#39;s a possible storyline:
<br>
<br>Meeting Local Leaders: Upon his arrival, Joe Biden could meet with various local leaders, Jarls (rulers of the different holds in Skyrim), and other influential figures to discuss the potential benefits of democracy. He could engage in diplomatic negotiations to encourage them to embrace these new ideas.
<br>
<br>Formation of a Council: Biden might propose the creation of a council composed of representatives from each hold. This council could be responsible for making important decisions, passing laws, and ensuring that the voice of the people is heard.
<br>
<br>Education and Outreach: Recognizing that introducing democracy requires understanding, Biden could establish educational programs to teach the people of Skyrim about democratic principles, the importance of voting, and the rule of law.
<br>
<br>Elections and Representation: With the council in place, elections could be held in each hold to choose representatives. These representatives would then discuss and vote on matters affecting their respective regions, fostering a sense of inclusivity and representation.
<br>
<br>Protection of Individual Rights: Biden might work to ensure that individual rights and freedoms are protected under this new system. This could involve drafting a constitution or a set of fundamental rights that all citizens of Skyrim are entitled to.
<br>
<br>Resistance and Challenges: Of course, not everyone in Skyrim may be eager to embrace these changes. Some traditionalists and those who benefit from the existing power structure might resist the introduction of democracy, leading to political and social challenges that Biden and his allies would need to navigate.
<br>
<br>Legacy and Future: Over time, Joe Biden&#39;s efforts could leave a lasting impact on Skyrim. As the land transitions to a more democratic society, future generations of Skyrim&#39;s inhabitants could continue to uphold these values.
<br>
<br>Remember, this scenario is entirely fictional and speculative, blending elements of the real world with the fictional universe of Skyrim. If you have any other creative ideas, questions, or topics you&#39;d like to explore, feel free to let me know!<sep>This episode... Fuckin&#39; nailed it!<sep>I love how he just destroyed Nazeem<sep>Are you fucking kidding me? How did you get a sponsor on these videos lmfao<sep>Making Biden get along with Nazeem 😂😂😂😂<sep>Skyrim has nothing on Oblivion - Biden wont make the dialog better for skyrim<sep>title but it a bit broken: Jouwa&#39;ghiijnj<sep>Ohhh please make this with trump, you dont even have to make up dialog.<sep>Joe Biden can&#39;t form whole sentences, and here he is, planing the whole puppet ruler thing. Totally out of character.<sep>I like how he explains that whole &quot;step down as a Jarl&quot; thing like a Wrestling plot.<sep>People get illusion of power but the prince of this world rules<sep>The way you deconstructed western democracy is truly a thing of beauty 🥲<sep>illegal invasion of iraq... I mean ukraine...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 TAKE MY FUCKING LIKES YOU HILARIOUS SON OF A BITCH!!!!<sep>You are a genius and you really know how they trick the sheep. You even added the hand signs. VERY WELL DONE.<br> I give this 11 out of 10<sep>There&#39;s definitely a reason we&#39;ve heard so much about RAID Shadow Legends. Mostly Dankula. Also, since it&#39;s just a stupid phone app, they can use every penny they make on advertising.<sep>Genuinely a good post. I need to remember joe biden The Spell.<sep>This series just gets better n better!! Lost my absolute SHIET at DB Putin! Holy crap I guess others made it into Skyrim that&#39;s hype as hell! Catching up again since episode 4 came out, with the new rise in awesome AI President memes, I wondered &quot;how&#39;s the OG first badass Joevahkiin doing?&quot; And I&#39;m happy to see, better than ever! Looking forward to catching up, this series is fuckin amazing! I hope Joe gets all his shit healed finally lol<sep>this should be a required watch in highschool to understand politics lmao<sep>This is becoming my new favorite Isekai anime.<sep>Well I have to say Joe didn&#39;t really ask for much for his save on Jarl, that favor though was a good idea.<sep>Joe really racking up those Speech skills<sep>bro good content haha<sep>Nazeem is the best part<sep>I feel like this should have been Trump. Would be more believable.<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSyg4xfcNv4&amp;t=516"">8:36</a> Johnny third leg lol<sep>Sleepy joe advertising 😂<sep>Wow seeing Biden saying something truthful is very strange!<sep>&quot;Don&#39;t tell my wife that.&quot;<br><br>Amazing.  He remembered he&#39;s married.<sep>&quot;So you&#39;re saying give the power to the people?&quot; <br>&quot; no.  Jesus, are you crazy?&quot;  <br><br>HAHAHAHAHA...ha...ha...   <b>sobs</b><sep>Holy shet wth. This episode taught me how murica works.<sep>I still love it that this channel criticises both sides of the political spectrum.<sep>the furry guild 😂<sep>Haha nice Nazeem got owned.  Finally!<sep>Biden literally just explained democracy in a nutshell when he was helping Jarl…<sep>The voicing to this sounds so realistic 😂🤣😂<sep>This is very smart and very funny<sep>Heimskr: Our town is run by the deep-state controlled by Balgruuf<sep>Ironically, that was Joe Biden&#39;s best speech in any timeline/universe.<sep>You’d think Lydia is way too old for Joe’s taste<sep>This would be alot funnier of we weren&#39;t living it 😂<sep>He should be down with sickness! Embrace the furry within!<sep>Biden never have been so coherent 🤣<sep>It&#39;s so fing good man<sep>This is the most eloquent speech Brandon has ever given<sep>Oh Lord, I love this.<sep>Braith Shadow Legends.<sep>I&#39;m pretty sure this is a true story.<sep>You gave Jon the wrong voice. Other than that, love this. Keep it up<sep>Where has this been<sep>Don&#39;t ruin this series with Raid dude...<sep>Holy crap, this is unironically epic. Joe actually did a pretty good job at that speech.<sep>I&#39;m calling it now, in a few episodes classified college documents will be found in his house in whiterun<sep>How have I never seen your vids before now<br><br>Seeing the skyrim meme community more relevant than ever is so great<sep>I am fully unpotioned and proud.<sep>“ Johnny 3rd leg “ had me dying lmao<sep>The loading screen with the drone strike ability lmaoo<sep>I wish Biden was actually able to speak so fluently<sep>This series is just what democracy needs.<sep>This is genuinely a good series that captures the essence of elder scrolls while being hilarious<sep>A sigma like Ulfric XDDDD<sep>Who else voting biden for sweet rolls and good memes<sep>Thanks!<sep>I have never seen a mash-up of two wildly different things go together so well since lamb and tuna fish. Lmao all jokes aside, please keep these coming! They are fucking fantastic!<sep>That was a really good ad may I just say xD<sep>The law of obligations when moral economics that Spinoza (c.a. 1700&#39;s) and Kant (c.a. 1800&#39;s) debate academic economics with moral construction of fact and law is involved with principles of the Democratic institution of political science.<sep>Skyrim Biden is much smarter than TV Biden.....<sep>These are a riot. Liked and subbed<sep>This is not a meme. This is a work of art!<sep>Never thought I&#39;d get a raid shadow legends ad from Biden xD<sep>Don&#39;t forget to control the guys counting the Whiterun election. A bit of ballot harvesting in the Cloud District wouldn&#39;t be remiss, either.<sep>This is so good it&#39;s not even a parody. This is EXACTLY what would happen if Biden was in Skyrim. All my Honningbrew Mead to you, dragonborn.<sep>We have two candidates propped up by the bit corporations<sep>I love how it is somewhat true based on American politics.<sep>R.I.P. Johnny. This series is absurdly funny, but managed to make me feel pain, too!<sep>In the past Joevahkiin episodes, Joe was unfamiliar with this new world and was likable for his ignorance while adjusting to the world of Skyrim.<br>In this Ep Joe is very plotting, slimy and backstabbing. why too similar to the real Joe!<sep>🎵 Joevahkiin joevahkiin , naal ok zin los vahriin 🎵<sep>Make it seem like they really hate each other over the Sweet Roll Tax 😂😂😂<sep>&quot;Keep working hard and maybe I&#39;ll see you up there one day&quot; should be an actual response option in the game once you become Thane of Whiterun.",1

V__C4j24jEY,If Mark Zuckerberg admitted that he is a Lizard Person | Deepfake,"What if Mark Zuckerberg was actually a Lizard. He's most likely not but its possible. This is a deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg revealing his True Identity as a Lizard person from Zarnath. This is inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiudBq7z8wk Mark was live on Facebook now called Meta in like 2016, and someone asked him if he is a Lizard Person, ever since then accusations started popping up that Mark is indeed a Lizard, he keeps on denying them. So I thought what would it look like if Mark were to come out and make a video revealing that he is in fact a Lizard person, so I set out to make this video lol.

What’s next levitating trains!!<sep>She pointy tough<sep>This fake asf<sep>jajajajajajaja<sep>Wtf is hilarius<sep>XDDDDDDD WTF<sep>This is funny<sep>From a technical perspective, the explosion appears to have been caused by a failure in the rocket&#39;s engines or other critical systems. This is not uncommon in the space industry, as rockets are complex machines with many points of failure.
<br>
<br>In terms of the impact on SpaceX, the company may experience delays in its launch schedule and face increased scrutiny from regulators and customers. However, SpaceX has a strong track record of success and has overcome setbacks in the past.
<br>
<br>As for Elon Musk&#39;s reaction in the video, it demonstrates his emotional connection to SpaceX and his commitment to pushing the boundaries of space exploration. However, it&#39;s worth noting that public displays of emotion from high-profile executives like Musk can have both positive and negative effects on the company&#39;s reputation and stock price.
<br>
<br>As a general advice would be for SpaceX to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion and take any necessary steps to prevent future incidents. It may also be wise for Musk to balance his emotional attachment to the company with a more measured public response in the future, particularly when it comes to events that can impact the company&#39;s image and financial performance.<sep>Had me for a while.<sep>This is crazy hilarious.

Imagine killing your best friend to obtain something that will be the only thing you will treasure for the rest of your days. Spending endless ages turning into a solitary monster in the depths of the underworld just to keep it with you, consumed by the obsession of its power. Losing yourself, losing everything you ever loved, for the sake of &quot;your precious&quot;.<br><br>And then, one day... it&#39;s gone. The Ring has left you. Everything you held dear, everything that kept you going through all this tormented eternity, is gone! Now what??? All these sacrifices, a whole lifetime of loneliness, torture and pain for what? The despair must be indescribable.<br><br>And somehow, Gollum doesn&#39;t just abandon all hope and die, instead he remains in agony, lamenting his misery in those caves for many more years until he&#39;s found, because the mere thought of finding his precious again keeps him alive. Well, if you can call that &quot;alive&quot;.... The Ring didn&#39;t let him live but neither die, it kept him a prisoner of its treacherous will. <br><br>What a dark and excruciatingly cruel character arc, Tolkien had a real talent for storytelling!<sep>in 10 years... cgi hasn&#39;t really changed<sep>Ya seen this same behavior at outside a speedway at 3am<sep>What’s the name of the soundtrack that’s starts playing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avwziu5Chpg&amp;t=119"">1:59</a><sep>Bilbo had to steal Gollum&#39;s video game. It was for his own good.<sep>I must be going deaf<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avwziu5Chpg&amp;t=25"">0:25</a> vapers when they lose they vape<sep>Good acting indeed<sep>The scene where the ring abandons him is… even worse when you realize that Sméagol killed his best friend and cousin, and lived allll those years turning into gollum in the misty mountains… only for the ring to abandon him..<sep>The sound quality of this video is fucking terrible..<sep>The ring is a metaphor for mobile phone, we have become as pitiable by its addiction, we become as restless when we cant find it<sep>I would drop kick that thing into the water<sep>Frodo: &quot;It&#39;s a pity Bilbo didn&#39;t kill him when he had the chance!&quot;<br><br>Gandalf: &quot;Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo&#39;s hand. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve to live. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment.

We need to talk.&quot;<sep>The look he made at the end got me<sep>He was everywhere<sep>This just almost perfect 😂😂<sep>It’s not funny when the timing is so slow tbh, that’s why the original meme worked is that it was short and to the point for the strangeness.  Having the guy just stare removes what made the meme work in the first place<sep>Spoilers<sep>The &quot;Hey guys I&#39;m in NYC&quot; meme and Oblivion were meant to be used together.<sep>Superb.<sep>Brilliant<sep>Seeing my friend martan whoop some deadeas ass<sep>I genuinely can&#39;t stop watching these.

Love the meme<br><br><br>But on an entirely different note<br>I am kinda furious that Oblivion, a game that came out in... What, 2005? 2007?

Best one so far :D<sep>All jokes and memes aside, this is by far one of the most memorable moments in Elder Scrolls history. Say what you will about Oblivion itself, but this scene will forever stay in the minds of ES fans until the end of time.

<br>
<br>It&#39;s important to remember that Joe Biden is a real-world political figure and not a character in a video game. The scenario you&#39;re describing is a playful and imaginative fusion of real-world and video game elements.

This is a fun edit showing Luke Skywalker that we know and love in the original trilogy but having his personally changed ....this Luke is known as Jake Skywalker, Jake Skymilker, Jake Milkwalker, etc...See as Jake Skywalker doesn't want to help destroy the Death Star, tells his friends to 'go away', tells everyone that the legacy of the Jedi is failure, likes to drink milk...a lot, and more.Audio voice for Jake Skywalker is from The Last Jedi and different interviews with Mark Hamill.

Can&#39;t wait till they make these canon.<sep>That was funny. Disney executives should have to watch that to remind themselves of their failure. They took a much loved character and - at every turn - made him do the opposite of what he would really do. Maybe it’s easier writing for mermaids, mice, or crickets.<sep>First!<sep>I can’t tell you how much I love this video!

Nonsense. This is 100% accurate, fuck the sequel trilogy and rian johnson<sep>Ruin Johnson killed so much.<sep>Jake is the 16 year old edgy emo version of Luke<sep>Even more depressing when you realize this is how Rian&#39;s Luke would act in character based on his version.

For years, the United States of America stood as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took up arms to defend our way of life against the Terrorists. In so doing, we never suspected that the greatest threat came from within. The Republicans, led by Trump, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of Communism using one of their own as the enemy&#39;s leader. They had hoped to grind the America into ruin. But the hatred in their hearts could not be hidden forever. At last, there came a day, when our enemies showed their true natures. The Republicans and Trump hoped to unleash their destructive power against the America by rigging the elections with the help from their cohorts in Russia, replace the head of government with their puppet and usurping control of the US army. But the aims of would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without elitist, dangerous powers. Our loyal police officers and national guardsmens contained the insurrection within the Republican Party and quelled uprisings on all states.
<br>The remaining Republicans will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. And their cohorts from Russia will meet their justice! These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on our America has left all of us scarred and deformed, but I assure you, that our resolves has never been stronger. The war is over. The Terrorists have been defeated, and the Republican rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the United States will be reorganized into the first United American Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that will continue to be ruled by this government and a president, democratically chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a new constitution!
<br>By bringing the entire America under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one individual, the corruption that plagued the United States in its later years will never take root. Regional senators will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the Separatist movement to grow unchecked. A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law. Under the Empire&#39;s New Order, our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enemies and will stand together against attacks from within or without. Let the enemies of the Empire take heed: those who challenge Imperial resolve will be crushed.
<br>We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Empire are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the America has traded war for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a secure future. The Empire will grow as more countries feel the call, from the North to the Souths of our great Continent. Our imperial citizens must do their part. Join our grand US Navy. Become the eyes of the Empire by reporting suspected insurrectionists. Travel to the corners of the world to spread the principles of the New Order to barbarians. Build monuments and technical wonders that will speak of our glory for generations to come. The US troopers, now proudly wearing the name of Imperial troopers, have tackled the dangerous work of fighting our enemies on the front lines. Many have died in their devotion to the Empire. Imperial citizens would do well to remember their example. The New Order of peace has triumphed over the shadowy secrecy of shameful magicians. The direction of our course is clear. I will lead the Empire to glories beyond imagining.
<br>We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We move forward as one people: the Imperial citizens of the first United American Empire. We will prevail. Ten thousand years of peace begins today! Glory to our new Empire!&quot; (Applause)
