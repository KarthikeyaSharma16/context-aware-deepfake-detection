p89NkyNcpHo,Ironman Recast - Michael Scott,"What if Ironman is recast as Michael Scott?

Instead of getting someone charming like Robert Downey Jr who makes you cry when he said ""love you 3000"" or cool when he says ""i am ironman"", maybe Marvel could go a comedy route and get Steve Carell aka Michael Scott from the Office.This is a funny edit, what if not to be taken serious.

But he harbors a deep secret, his life has been defined by a never ending pursuit of revenge against his childhood nemesis, the infamous Corn Pop.As he digs deeper into the powerful global network supporting Corn Pop, the beef starts ruffling feathers at the top, and he realizes he must take things into his own hands.Leaving a Mitch McConnell body double in his place, he leaves the White House and embarks on a quest to bring truth, justice, and the American way to Corn Pop and his Allies.….

However, let&#39;s explore how this encounter might unfold:
<br>
<br>Joe Biden and Jordan Peterson, both renowned for their distinct perspectives, could arrive in Skyrim separately and become involved in its complex political and social landscape. Here&#39;s a speculative narrative:
<br>
<br>Unlikely Meeting: By chance, Joe Biden and Jordan Peterson cross paths in one of Skyrim&#39;s bustling cities. Initially, their differences in political and philosophical views could lead to interesting interactions and debates.
<br>
<br>Shared Goals: Despite their differences, they might discover a common goal related to fostering open dialogue and understanding among the diverse inhabitants of Skyrim. They recognize the need to address pressing issues and seek solutions that benefit the realm.
<br>
<br>Town Hall Event: Inspired by their real-world experiences, Biden and Peterson could organize a town hall event in a major city. This event would bring together citizens of Skyrim from different walks of life to discuss important matters and bridge ideological gaps.
<br>
<br>Debates and Discussions: Biden and Peterson could engage in debates and discussions on topics such as governance, individual rights, morality, and societal progress. These interactions would encourage critical thinking and challenge the people of Skyrim to question their assumptions.
<br>
<br>Collaborative Solutions: As they continue to interact with the people of Skyrim, Biden and Peterson might find areas of agreement and work together to propose innovative solutions to some of the land&#39;s challenges, whether it&#39;s addressing conflicts between different factions or promoting economic development.
<br>
<br>Influence on Skyrim: Through their efforts, Biden and Peterson&#39;s ideas could begin to shape the political and cultural landscape of Skyrim. Their emphasis on dialogue, empathy, and personal growth could inspire individuals across the realm to seek common ground and find ways to coexist peacefully.
<br>
<br>Return to the Real World: Eventually, Biden and Peterson would need to find a way back to the real world. Their experiences in Skyrim would leave a lasting impact on the land, influencing its future and leaving behind a legacy of cooperation and understanding.

<br>Remember, this scenario is entirely fictional and speculative, intended for creative exploration. If you have any other imaginative ideas, questions, or topics you&#39;d like to discuss, feel free to share!<sep>Joes stories in the carriage sound exactly like grandpa simpson&#39;s stories.<sep>please add Andrew tate<sep>good to see this videos while the real world is falling apart<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLx0cWXhPIA&amp;t=182"">3:02</a><br>Wait... wait-wait-wait... uh... so I tried to ACTUALLY think about WHY Biden has a $19 Fortnite card. It wasn&#39;t long but I came up with 3 possibilities...<br><br>- He literally just got the card because he recognized something that kids like and decided to find out what it is so then found the game and POSSIBLY found it&#39;s free to play (if it&#39;s free to play, I honestly don&#39;t know, never played, I&#39;m not a Zoomer) and/or just spent $1 on something and played for a few seconds or minutes possibly even only until he died and got confused and frustrated and stopped so that he can TECHNICALLY say truthfully &quot;I played Fortnite.&quot; Which honestly... would be a funny thing for him to say. Like, genuinely. Really. The mere idea of him CLAIMING he did regardless of if it&#39;s true, even if it&#39;s as a joke, would very possibly make me laugh quite a bit. And that would be weird to do if it&#39;s not to a horrible gaffe.<br><br>- He got it because kids like it and well maybe young girls who smell nice like it too?<br><br>- I can&#39;t remember the third one, but I mean... YOU wanna try and come up with a reason why he has that? Because if you&#39;re gonna claim that &quot;Joe Biden might be an avid Fortnite gamer,&quot; or even &quot;Joe Biden might be an avid gamer...&quot; IMMA NEED SOURCES FOR THIS CLAIM!<br><br>Like Matthew Perry from Friends! He played Fallout 3, LOVED it, talked about it when he met Ellen Degeneres or however her name is spelled and ultimately it would seem that some people noticed because he then voiced a lead protagonist (the character who voices the opening, in fact) of the later game FallOut: New Vegas... so if you told me Matthew Perry is an avid gamer, my likely reply would be &quot;Probably, yeah, which is awesome, and for good reason, it&#39;s made him damn good money and helped his acting career and who knows maybe he&#39;ll find more work with Obsidian in another Fallout game if Bethesda will LET THEM MAKE ONE, or to my ignorance already voices a character or maybe even multiple characters but without me even knowing.<br><br>... Though somehow I doubt Bethesda hired Perry for FO4... because uh... New Vegas left BIIIIIIIG shoes to fill. MIGHTY big shoes. Massive shoes that have left footprints visible to this day over a decade later.<br><br>People... fucking... LOVE FallOut New Vegas in the community of people who like FallOut. It just seems like THE game that is favored most, at least for FallOut fans who are not traditionalists glued to the first two and foresake the first-person one since FO3. They obviously might NOT hold New Vegas in high regard, but for those who embrace FO3 and/or FO4 AND New Vegas? New Vegas is often THE favorite, probably more often than not, than ANY other. And I say that as someone who will confess to coming to the fact that I ACTUALLY prefer FO4 which apparently some people really hate or think is only okay and is a disappointment compared to New Vegas. Differences of opinion exist, and that is okay... I just really like the graphics, gunplay, firearm customization, settlement building system, and the way they fleshed out Synths from their early FO3 mentions of &#39;androids?&#39; Chef&#39;s kiss... I have thought long and deep on the concept and find it fun to think about, whether they count as humans or not (no offense to Synths intended, but uh... no, not human, but for those who act civil and honest and forthright and ACT morally... even if they&#39;re kinda abrasive like that woman at The Railroad with the minigun... well, I can treat that Synth similar to a human or even possibly with... no, not &#39;possibly,&#39; I&#39;d treat that Synth with more respect than a human being who acts less civil/honest/forthright/morally. Just like if a trans woman like Blaire White will put in such phenomenal due diligence to REALLY earn it and make it come naturally due to feminine beauty regardless of true gender (often referred to as &#39;sex&#39; to differentiate it because biology is inconvenient to lefist ideological drivel) I&#39;ll conduct myself like she is a genuine woman. In fact in Blare&#39;s case, I respect her so much I can speak her pronouns but find myself not wanting to actually say... you know... the biological thing. Because that COULD be offensive/rude to her, or maybe she&#39;s TOTALLY cool with it though probably not really but she DOES seem really cool and chill however regardless of that view of mine I don&#39;t even really wanna say something to risk offending her. Honestly.<br><br>Haha ol&#39; &quot;Cereal Box&quot; Bruce, uh, I have respect... and I&#39;ll start a fresh new paragraph as a small show of respect to just to put that singular name aside... that happens to also be the name of one... bat-related superhero (COINCIDENCE?! I think SO! I mean really... I actually JUST started... okay now I&#39;m laughing harder as I ACTIVELY try to imagine that concept...)<br><br>But yeah, I do have respect for Ms or Mrs.Jenner, seen her on Fox and she&#39;s very much chill on Gutfeld, if I liked her political positions enough and had no superior alternatives I&#39;d even vote for her despite the gender dysphoria or whatever the term may be, possibly coupled with PTSD because... KARDASHIANS!<br><br>Oh and one last comment on FO4, sorry I love that game and play it more than I should, but I also like the Boston accent, but I didn&#39;t want to include it in the mentions of things I like about FO4 because well... do I NOT like the accents in New Vegas? Shag off with that idea, the accents are great and Mr. New Vegas is a perfectly respectful yet at times playful/flirty/romantic voice always available in the Mojave and sounding warm and gentle and approachable and welcoming and caring.. Elderly women want him, and I guess possibly young women with a possible grandpa or nurse fetish... some people like to be freaky, what? Don&#39;t judge, hand over YOUR search history! And, young men want to BE him... in like... 20-60 depending on the perspective of the man... and life expectancy... given what the Courier goes through and FallOut protagonists in general I&#39;d advise signing up for life insurance unless they know of neither a charity to accept the money or a family member and I would NOT spend too much time thinking on life expectancy though no doubt MANY FallOut fans have pondered on the thought of certain protagonists living a certain amount of time and MAYBE traveling a certain distance and MAYBE could be a character in a certain game... and by that I think the Courier of New Vegas is Sheffield in Diamond City who you can buy as a sla-... recruit as an unquestioning settler to one of your settlements. Sorry, couldn&#39;t help with that last... no, not one joke, two! Sheffield being the Courier who apparently was like 40-50 or older and was an alcoholic and then became addicted to Nuka Cola which is the only thing that makes him think straight, which I SERIOUSLY do not believe  and in fact HOPE is not true because... SAD... and kinda annoying but still I try to help him and armor him and give him something to defend himself with.<br><br>Of course No Bark is the one that most people would think I&#39;m referring to, whom some speculate MIGHT be the Chosen One of FallOut 2, possibly having suffered a head injury during a... uh... &#39;accident&#39; of one that you MIGHT not particularly... expect... in FallOut... and I ain&#39;t talkin&#39; vertibirds though hey find the crashed vertibird closest to Novac, not that any SPECIFICALLY come to mind, and someone could come up (or has already come up) with something lol<br><br>I&#39;m Sorry. Like really... I&#39;m low-key angry at myself for spending THIS many minutes on this ONE YouTube comment, and I HOPE I don&#39;t have to edit it!<sep>D-dude... I never had a &quot;Like and subscribe&quot; kinda thing at the end with... well I mean if that HAPPENED... like if I received an Official-looking message from the White House and looked up the White House and inquired and they say &quot;Yes, it is true, the President has decreed that the FBI will release YOUR personal search history if you do not subscribe to this YouTube channel...&quot; fuck.<br><br>I mean honestly, offer death. It&#39;d be more merciful... there&#39;s no need to be excessive. Makes &quot;Receiving a photo of a ghillie-suited person with a scoped rifle aiming it from a discrete prone position with YOUR WINDOW visible in the distance&quot; seem almost tame. Have mercy, for the love of God... even if God knows all our search histories...<br><br>... and now I feel sad... I&#39;m going to drink more, that usually makes me less sad and more &quot;WOO let&#39;s get some MUSIC on!&quot;<sep>who Hermaeus Mora in Jóvahkiin seriezs?<sep>I want Obama and Trump in this series as well lol<sep>Rewatching for the 4th time<sep>love a good pinemato<sep>That whole JFK sequence was a piece of art<sep>Jordan Peterson real MVP<sep>Great shit as always!

Skyrim, on the other hand, is a fictional world from the popular video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.&quot;
<br>
<br>Mixing real-world individuals with fictional settings can lead to humorous or imaginative scenarios, but it&#39;s crucial to approach such scenarios with sensitivity and respect. If you&#39;re interested in creating a creative story involving Joe Biden waking up in Skyrim, you could consider focusing on the contrast between the real world and the fantasy realm, his reactions to the strange environment, and the challenges he might face. Just remember to keep it lighthearted and respectful.<sep>pedo JOE<sep>Best AI Deepfakes ever<sep>Talos save the Empire, man.<sep>I&#39;m a long-time fan of Skyrim and this is just hysterical. 😆😂🤣<sep>certified classic<sep>Noooo man I thought it was gonna be &quot;JOOOOOO BIDEN WAKE UP&quot;<sep>Best Isekai anime 10/10<sep>This is just gold man haha<sep>I&#39;m waiting for the Obama and Donald Trump mods<sep>What would have made more sense is the cart going completely off route due to this mod<sep>wake up sleepy joe😅<sep>Wow<sep>😂😂😂<sep>This video proves: you don’t do heroine kids.<sep>This is the best thing ive ever seen<sep>I can&#39;t believe when I was I listening to AI Joe Biden in Skyrim a year ago, I&#39;d yet again be reassuring my superior taste in culture to myself and the uncultured masses of the future.<sep>Joe Biden Wake Up!<sep>How do you do Biden’s movements?<sep>Lmfao<sep>So he tries to cross the border...

And trip you up<sep>Blo woa hell hell hell<sep>Yeah, my word my word documents I can’t use word. He messed my computer up so bad Microsoft is working on it and I am not on his team Robert Pegues team I’m on Elon and Zuckerberg and I am on no team of Roberts I’m Met Bill Gates with President Trump over in a castle somewhere and he’s been mentoring me. He offered me a job, and if Robert Bugai is working on a job with Bill Gates it’s not because of me he stocking me Robert the gay, not Bill Gates. Bill Gates is my friend and I’ve been using Microsoft since day one of the computer but I just want to be free of him because I’m gonna have a heart attack. If this keeps up I mean he’s it feel like he’s chasing you know me and trying to ruin me and then at the same time I win and then it’s never good enough for you and then you give it to him anyway or some thing or whatever I get these horrible feelings from him that energy I get that her energy from Hillary than I do from him and I don’t know but I don’t know what to say but when he bought that property in Scottsdale with Pat McKiernan and they wanted to give me a house with him in Scottsdale instead of prosecuting her oh hell no I’ll take her down with my bare hands and him, her husband, they’re wicked people After what they did to me and my children and my parents in my house and the whole neighborhood no make a deal with her no not with her and it’s not up to me anyway, this is Jason‘s case and I went when they said Nadi was in the newspaper dying of lung cancer, and when he died, I called her up I had prayed about it and God said you know you got to forgive her so I did and I called her up and you know she’s bragging about Carrie weeks I guess curry her daughter is very good at math and you know I let her rent on and on and on, and then I started in about Jason and I almost gave him away And I had to go I said look Pat I said I’m sorry about Maddie. I said I’m sorry about your bladder cancer. I said I have to go now. I hope everything will work out and Jason was furious at me mom what are you doing? you know making peace with her you almost gave me away, and I had no idea that Jason had any information about her whatsoever because he was in high school when this happened on the football team and all he wanted to do was play football and she destroyed him and her computer was right at the back window of her house and she either would live on that all day or I am honest with you smoking in her bedroom walk-in closet and I’ll be like pat your kids are out here that you know I got to go home where after I’d have coffee And shit come out and then like later on in the afternoon or whatever Auren and want to go play with Addie and we’d go over and Jeff would come to the door and she’d be knocked out again and it turned out she’s a drug addict she went to Richard Gottlieb my psychiatrist And he said to her no I’m not putting you on the Xanax. He said you’re not like her he said your drug seeking behavior is why you’re here and she comes home to me and she said well tell me how did you get it out of him I said, what are you talking about? Well he wouldn’t give me Xanax what he gives it to you And I said Pat I was very sick I almost was in the hospital. I said I don’t know what you’re talking about. I said if he doesn’t give it to you, maybe you don’t need it, and it went on, and she signs her self into Camelback mountain hospital for the mentally ill and drug addicted and alcohol to get on more drugs And then she’d go to that instead of going to the casino and then she got I think she had problems with her teeth and then the dentist all the Dennis. She was getting drugs from prescription drugs and then when I had Ireland, she said to me oh, are you better? Be careful he might get custody of her, and that’s exactly what ended up happening donis gave her to him and then he kidnapped her to Prescott and Fran got her back only because Fran finally believed in what was happening with me and then Fran said I can’t bring her back to her room I guess because it had to go to court and because CPS had custody and you can’t do the change of custody right after a guardian ad litem can’t do a change of custody legally, so Fran did protect her as far as I know I don’t know enough about it OK thank you<sep>I said that about Microsoft when did I said I was sitting here standing with the deck of CDs are in front of that or on the side of the loveseat with the black case and it was gone and I said OK that’s it my my it’s I don’t know what I was looking at and I did say that and then it happened and it came back and then I made him get it off because that’s piracy And that’s what the Chinese students got in trouble for and more than that I mean they hacked into the mainframe at Peninsula college and when it was going on, I was in the math lab and everybody was in trouble except me and the reason I wasn’t in trouble, Larry Smith told me was because my testing was monitored, and in the in the testing lab and my computer was separate anyway that’s about where we’re at and I’m sorry like slow today. I am upset because I am I don’t know what to do about Bobbie . I don’t know what to do about Linda being involved with these people this sad group of people that’s going to go around killing people because I was on a comment in internal affairs and I am, I said some thing about her isles like I don’t know if I’m crazy or if when Marshall law takes affect they have to at some point walk and I would think make logistics in and out of the homes and they won’t be able to get in her house and I don’t know what happened Auren so I’ve been trying to tell her Linda you can’t walk in this place there’s 1 inch in between the furniture and it’s like hoarding furniture and so she’s the one making it better. I’m organizing now and it’s clean it’s not like it is her house is very clean cleaner than mine of course but I mean, so she’s organizing all of it but what I’m worried about is if she gets hurt and they can’t get her out in an ambulance and that’s what I said to her and she had a fit and she said online murder and they’re all saying that and now yesterday it was it yesterday when I was on the patio I don’t remember the last time I was on the patio I believe it was yesterday and I was out there and she started to walk over and I said oh hi Lynn, it’s beautiful out. I said I want to tell you about BlackBerry and I said my company too much she said oh yeah I saw that but you’re crazy so she started to walk back home and I am so tired of people telling me I’m crazy, and this is the exact same thing I went through in Arizona with a Pat McKiernan and her moving Nancy, her friend into David’s house to spot me spot me and every time I come out or whatever Nancy would let Pat know I mean I knew what was going on but what was I gonna do about it and I don’t know what they were up to and how that all worked out but like I was on intensive probation because they were calling and they had my probation officers Gerie Gervais Anda they had her so convinced that I must’ve been drinking even though I wasn’t drinking and she knew I wasn’t drinking because I was being you aid at every you know time I went there were never any alcohol. There were never any positive that drug or alcohol tests and I always reported with my medication‘s and you know I did what I was supposed to do and I may have been. I don’t remember on a contract or the medication and if I was, I followed it but no Jerry Jouvay in intensive probation you pay right in front of your officer so you can’t dilute it or do anything like that and McKiernan had going around Scottsdale that I was pouring water down my leg or pouring water into the P is no way you can do that and not only that then I caught her putting wine bottles in my garbage and one of the. I think it was white like one of the guys girlfriends or wives came over one time with a bottle of cold duck and left it in my refrigerator half open and Sherry ‘s in the house and she said well there’s a bottle and a half open bottle a call duck in your refrigerator. I said probably is somebody like Barb’s or somebody else because I drink beer if I drink and I said I’m not drinking and I said if I drink wine or alcohol or whatever I’ll tell you if I do it I love it was mine I would say right now and then hey it’s mine and I think she would agree that you know I didn’t lie to her another time that I did get in trouble on probation with Jerry Jervey. I had Ireland and I had Auren and we were in Smitty’s and we were getting groceries and shopping and looking around and I needed a oh what do you call it? It’s like a blender but it’s a step blender you put in a glass and you I wanted it to mix formula with for Ireland and sell. I had it it’s a Lego it’s an electric oh I can’t think of the name of it like a whisk but it’s a electric mixer and you do you stick it in a pitcher of liquid or you know you can make soup with it or formula or baby food well anyway I got her one and I stuck it on the top of her umbrella so it was where Auren couldn’t touch it because that one point I had him buy me and then I had her in her car seat on top of everything and I’m going through the line and I forgot it you couldn’t even see it. The roof was down on her to her umbrella over that went attached to her car seat so I go through the line I pay for my groceries and I want I’m walking out the door and the man’s Social Security says you have items that you haven’t paid for I said I do I didn’t I paid for everything and he said no you’re stealing a blender I said a blender and then I said oh that I said you mean they didn’t I didn’t get charge for that. I said it’s on top of her umbrella and so then he said well come in here and to the office so I went into the office and I called Jerry and I asked Sherry I said Sherry I said I have the money I can pay the man and she said no she said you go home take the kids and go home and I’ll come in and I’ll look at the tape and she came in the store which I thought was very kind of her and I didn’t get arrested and I don’t remember if I paid for it eventually because I did have one for Irelan’s formula and a I think I went back and paid the man but do you know I’ve made mistakes but the set ups of my caring this was wild it was relentless and if I were Tom OConnell and Eli were Fran, Baisden or Jerry Trevet, or anybody else I don’t know if I would’ve gone as far as they did I don’t know now I know Jerry’s not a part of it I know I don’t believe I know Ricky is not a part of it. Ricky is the one who told me about it a and there’s one other person that worked with Tommy that told me he shredded the record and I can’t think of her name. She was my probation officer in Scottsdale and he kept saying that I was crazy and in fact that you know I needed. I was so mentally ill that I couldn’t take care of myself and she said oh no why I disagree she said I think your sister is very well put together. She always knows what holiday it is and her house is always decorated and when you walk in the door you know Christmas is coming or whatever holiday it is you know Valentine’s Day or whatever because as soon as you walk in, she has all these beautiful decorations well how I remember her saying that I don’t remember how I heard it and then with the program and all the holidays getting mixed up, I remembered her either it was written in a report that I saw copy of or I heard her telling him at one point I don’t remember and I’m trying to think of her name oh Karen her name is Karen and I believe it was her when I called Scottsdale adult probation that told me that when I was trying to file the paperwork from Jason for my pardon and I couldn’t find paperwork anywhere in Arizona and then I thought well maybe the CIA cleaned it up and it was being stored somewhere and then Karen said no. He destroyed it he shredded it because he didn’t want you to come back and he said next time should go to prison and she’ll never get out or something to that effect, and I got off the phone and I cried, and that’s when I wrote to President Bush, thank you I appreciate all you all three of you in your time in supporting while this case I mean is it ever going to end? Is there a certain point where we move on or how does this? How does this go from here I mean they can make up things they did. They made up so much stuff.<sep>Do you know the soap it very well could be Bobbie she said something similar and I went what, but her skin is so dry and she’s got some kind of a virus at I was scared I was gonna get it is I don’t know it’s like white, it almost looks like warts, but it’s all over her legs Like a rash but she’s been to doctors out at a Shelley went there for her biopsy on her skin cancer what is his name Dr. Vlad he’s out at going towards the damn bar her what do you call that dermatology dermatology and I think he told her what it was and I said well you need to write it down one of these times I said, because how can I research it if I don’t know the name and she didn’t know and whatever I am not living with her no way guys I can’t take care of her. I mean I can help pay to put her somewhere but I can’t do it myself and I’m not gonna do that if he’s around her son because unless he’s on some kind of a program I will help her she can go back on her Birth certificate as a Smith I think from her I think it’s her father maybe and on her mother, she’s part Indian, so I don’t know what tribe, but it wouldn’t be that hard to do because she’s from Yuba City California, and they only live in poor huts you know like come fruit picker hut and that kind of stuff and she will she gets like 3000 a month from his Illinois and Social Security so she’s OK but her car payments like 600 a month and he takes the car and I don’t know what he’s doing with cars Carl I don’t know but I think that might be her with the soap are you so I use ivory soap sometimes and I use Castile right now I’m using pure Castile soap, so I don’t know<sep>Not me I never had a sweater with static because yeah, I don’t put any of my clothes in the dryer in case you people haven’t noticed that’s how you get static in a sweater that’s a Pat McKiernan and her laundry oh Lord but I can’t talk my laundry in Scottsdale was the same way, but my laundry was always done and my kids always had clean clothes for for school but no I hardly ever use my dryer. Ask Jason there were always clothes hanging in the bathroom, their shirts all their sweaters I never put anything like that in the dryer and I don’t know static we had water spray so I don’t know I’ve never had a static like I said no dryer no sweater in the dryer you don’t get static, so why would anyone take a sweater back because it had static electricity oh, she’s reaching<sep>Ryan says you have my word like when he said you have my word I’ll bring Liliana up there in the spring and I said Ryan you always say that and I said let me talk to Margaret and she said the same thing that they would come and you know they’ve never come back and it’s the same thing with money. He makes tons of money and he supports her family and he knew I needed help with my expenses. When I graduated college I lost an income and in order to do the campaign I said look, I need $100 a month from each one of you kids And Jason says I can’t do it. Ryan says no I can’t do it. Auren says I definitely can’t do it. Auren says can’t Saint Joseph’s church continue to support you and pay your rent and I said Auren why should Saint Joseph’s and why should Saint Vincent de Paul be paying my rent when I’m short on money to meet and pay my bills I said, where is my inheritance and they all go oh it’s water under the bridge And then I ask him again look I need help until I can get to the stimulus money and I’m going to get the stimulus but Desiree says that Berry doesn’t wanna have to wait months and months and months. Oh well we can’t help you, so why are you calling us we told you we want to we don’t want to talk to you about money And then when I had to take my bachelor level financial management course Auren is asking me questions and I’m telling him things so then I had to know cryptocurrency and Blockchain and I didn’t understand it and you guys know I still don’t understand all of it not enough to do practical use and I said to Auren I said Auren can you please sit down with me instead of going in the garage and working on your car? I need to know bitcoin Auren I need to know crypto I don’t understand it I I don’t have a book on it and I said I usually need a book on the subject in order to grapple a new concept in math and he says oh don’t worry about it you don’t make enough money anyway to have to worry about cryptocurrency I’ve told you that before The governments gonna take care of you anyway so then I ask Ryan and I asked Ryan I said Ryan I need some assistance I can’t make my rent I’m short I don’t have enough money for food so then Ryan says well if you don’t pay the rent I’m gonna put you in Alaska I said Alaska what does that have to do with helping me out so you know this is been going on and on and I’m tired out I can’t do anymore. I am ready to just walk or hitchhike to Florida and I’ve never hitchhiked in my life but now do you see what I mean? I have no support system and then all of a sudden oh I’m doing Disney and oh I sent Jason a $9 million house and I tell him now this is what I want and they all think oh she’s gotten into Herb‘s money, and then Tommy calls me. Oh no no wait I’m sorry strike it. It was Auren calls me an arm and says mom Tommy wants to manage your money. We’re all worried about you not paying the rent so now all of a sudden it becomes their concern and I said well don’t worry about it I’ll take care of it. You don’t want to be involved in money, so what is Tommy concerned about? Oh he loves you and he wants to help you and I said well if he wants to help me, let him give me my inheritance so then I said I can’t talk on this phone and I hang up and I don’t want to work with Tommy and and he knows that I said no I won’t work with Tommy not after what he did to me why would I I’d have to be an absolute fool so then Auren calls that well mom all manage your money and you can move over on this side closer to me and Lachelle I said no Auren I’m not moving over closer to you and Lachelle I said and you’re not managing my money I said, I’ll do it fine on my own and he says well you’re on organized in your manic and you’re not on the right medication and you’re this and you know I went on and on I hung up And then I get a DCR at my front door from the New World order I said hi how are you? Oh well I’m here I said in or where are you from and he says well you have to let me and I said no I don’t you don’t have any paperwork I don’t know who you are and I don’t know where you’re from how many says one from down there he says I’m here to check on your medication’s. I said nobody’s coming in my house and he says you have to let me in or the police will be here so I said well are you with Peninsula Behavioral Health no, he said I’m just here to see if you’re OK Auren sent me, so I said how did Auren get a hold of you and he said he called the police I said oh come on in so he stood in the door no ID no identification and here I am hurt on crutches and I let it go so he says I’ll be back I wanna make sure you have enough food and water and Auren is really concerned about you. I said well I said I work with President in Obama. I said he knows this and I said tell him he doesn’t have to be concerned I said he could help me out by getting somebody to come in here and clean and Jesus yeah I could tell that you got a problem here he said, and I said well they don’t have any workers I qualify for Tulsa for Tosa and they put me on a one-year waiting list a year and a half ago and I still don’t have anybody and they’re getting paid so that’s fraud right there. They already gotten paid a year and it’s kind of like you know the death of the state does not have any caregivers or house cleaners but they’re getting paid to do it for me I don’t understand and then a couple times when I got off of St. Vincent de Paul support and I graduated Peninsula college and I couldn’t pay rent because I pay everything else first so that they don’t cancel my cards like they’ve done now or turn the lights off or whatever I always had money. I was always lucrative and I didn’t know anybody anything and they’ve got me so screwed up because Auren couldn’t take it there so jealous all of them and now he gives me a card then if I go in a store and he doesn’t want me to buy it I can’t buy it that’s communist sick and I don’t know how he got involved with whoever it is, he’s involved with these people I don’t want to say Satanist because I know Satanist and they’re not like him they’re nicer than him and they’re more levelheaded than him and I don’t know what’s wrong with him except I know he’s being influenced by Arizona and I’m upset today over that computer because I never ever played around with a computer.<sep>My old software was sitting in my CD case. If you’re referencing my Microsoft software that was old my old computer, Alicia took I don’t know where she took it. There’s a place a recycling place because she gave me a computer because I didn’t have a computer to go to school with and my other computer. My laptop that Jason bought me that broke is here still so no I didn’t. I didn’t do anything with software. I never had any software stolen that I know of. I’ve never made a copy of any.<sep>Keep the videos coming. I love it.<sep>Are They playing, first who will laugh on others joke will lose ? 😄<sep>😂😂😂😂<sep>hi. how are you 🙂 my. all. USA.

It&#39;s even more disturbing that most appear to only care about the jokes, jokes they&#39;ve heard 1000 times before.

Another black joke, another nazi joke, another 9/11 joke, only digging us deeper and deeper into an inevitable end. Honestly, if you tell me any of these jokes, I&#39;ll treat you as an NPC. What saddens me the most is what we’ll lose in the process of A.I evolution, something that makes us very special: creativity.
