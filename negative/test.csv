xAPIjhkXF-0,Tom Cruise gives the most epic answer ever.,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAPIjhkXF-0,"Over +150,000 views!  Thank you 🙌  <br><br>Watch the full interview with Tom Cruise ▶️ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E01HHfdo6Cs"">https://youtu.be/E01HHfdo6Cs</a><sep>That&#39;s one creepy man🤮<sep>Waking up and having to decide which of your two planes to fly sounds like a cool problem to have. Tom Cruise definitely knows how to be rich in a good way and knows how to have fun 😃👍<sep>I wonder what Ron Hubbard&#39;s doing right now in hell Tom Cruise is doing a pretty good job well he&#39;s still here I wonder if he&#39;s going to be with Ron Hubbard someday<sep>Tom Cruise is incredible<sep>Sicnetology forever.<sep>Good grief, for a moment I thought it was Christian Bale in American Psycho<sep>these AI images are way too flattering<sep>Whats epic about that sh it<sep>He looks like he has some VHS 📼 tapes to return…<sep>STUPID,,,yeah,,,, TODAY I WILL BE DOCTOR AND TOMORROW A BANKER AND AN INVESTMENT FIRM = 20 years jail...<sep>i like how tom hasn’t started injecting or implanting his face like most of the other celebrities smart<sep>There is nothing &quot;epic&quot; about someone who promotes and supports a scam called Scientology that victimizes people, separating them from their family and scamming them out of their money in a scheme created by a crappy science fiction writer and con artist. Cruise is the second most important and influential person in the scam that has hurt so many and should be in prison.<sep>The question: Have you tried the little sandwiches?<sep>Said no one ever, except, Tom Cruise. Legend<sep>This is the first time he doesn’t look like a boy<sep>My guess is: do you prefer tea or coffee?😛<sep>what a Weirdo<sep>My kind of guy!<sep>To all the self righteous commenters on here who seem to be confused by his behavior, apparently you’re unfamiliar with how celebrities behave. Your petty judgmental comments reveal more about you than about Tom. So plz do yourself a favor and just STFU!<br><br>And whatever a celebrity does in their off time has zero effect or impact on us the viewer. If Tom wants to worship an alien being in the sky, then so be it. Wtf do you care!!! Seriously, find something else to complain about cuz it’s getting old.<sep>P51 is right up there with the Spitfire in terms of most beautiful planes of ww2. In my opinion of course<sep>Tom Who???<sep>Starting to look his age now<sep>He looks better with short hair.<sep>Damb, bro is good looking here.<sep>Nudist pilot?<sep>Hes Awesome!<sep>at this point I don’t know if it’s real Tom Cruise or AI Tom Cruise<sep>youre not going wear the same WHERE IS SHELLEY MISCAVIGE everyday<sep>I cannot even BELIEVE that they have put this man in a wig.<sep>I wear the same shirt every day, one like Ricky Gervais<sep>Boycott Scientology Cruise. Not a good person!<sep>Still gorgeous and very charming❤<sep>Gay Cruise<sep>Complete and utter can&#39;t.<sep>Loved the movie a few good men.<sep>Jaysus!!!<sep>Always acting, always the mind behind is ticking.<sep>What was the question? <br>Them: Which star system can you afford to live in? <br>Him: both<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wrong"">#wrong</a> answers only please<sep>He needs a better dentist<sep>He has a resemblance/ mannerisms as the leader of scientology.<sep>So cringy<sep>If you were wondering what the question was it was......Where does the sun rise?<sep>Uhm I’ve been wearing some of the same shirts since high school and I’ve been out of high school for 10 years now<sep>Tom is going to feel like he is directly behind the hottest  afterburner for eternity unless he repents and turns to the One True God and believes upon The Lord Jesus Christ!!!<sep>The cult of Scientology just loves him and the $$ he brings… He’s a total Kreep<sep>Is that makeup? Some baking ..<sep>Whatever<sep>Get that wig hat off your head. Ridiculous.<sep>Tom is aging like a normal person. He&#39;s one of us. 👍🏻<sep>💙💙💙💙💙👄👄👄👄<sep>Tom Cruise recently disclosed how he purposely had his top front teeth shifted one spot to the left in order to offset the weight of his large and unbalanced ego.<br><br>He is admittedly now feeling almost perfectly calibrated and finds himself feeling more centered. Much like his tooth.<sep>Now that I&#39;ve noticed It I can never focus on  anything other than how his top right front tooth is actually in the center of his mouth/face. His smile is off center. <br><br>Good luck not getting stuck staring at this detail from now on when you see one of his movies or interviews.<sep>How is this &quot;epic&quot;??<br>When you fart do you go &quot;Wow!&quot;??<sep>They asked him who he&#39;s dating.<sep>Before or after being in the Torture Chamber at Scientology GULAG..!! HEY Tom..!!<sep>Sometimes you want to be a narcissist cult member 🤔<sep>Mean while shepherd: same shit different days but the power always finds a place to rest its head<sep><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23early_access_waitinglist"">#early_access_waitinglist</a><sep>For reference. Tom was asked how he feels now that he identifies as a plane.<sep>Somedays I want to ben on a F-18, somedays ona P-51. But, EVERYDAY I have to be on the fucking bus.<sep>Who is this balloon knot? I never heard of him.<sep>WORST VIDEO EVER<br><b><i>What&#39;s the point of the whole video when u don&#39;t show the question?!</i></b> <br>WHY IS THIS EVEN RECOMMENDED?!<sep>….but will always be prick that cannot act!<sep>👍😊✨✨✨🇺🇸🕊️✨💯👍.  Hello. You.  ✨<sep>This is probably an AI<sep>Tom Hanks Likeable Too<br>Doubting Thomas<br>&#39;My Lord and my God;<br>You believe because you&#39;ve seen Me.<br>Blessed Are Those Who Haven&#39;t But They Obey What I Say!<br>This is the day that the Lord Jesus the Christ Once For All Sacrifice Paid In Full. No Vatican Bulls***.<br>Freemasons Jesuits Elite pursue what they always do! Bilderberg COP 28 Pharmaceutical Conglomerates without liability insurance.<br>The Bridegroom Cometh Imminently Soon To A Toon Near You!<sep>Some days you wake up sane, some days you wake up praising lord zenu.. ya know…<sep>Knob<sep>Finally looking old. Like the rest of us. God bless Scientology<sep>He looks so much better with short hair. His longer hair looks sloppy.<sep>still can&#39;t stomach his scientology sht.<sep>I wear the same shirt every day. I am a conservative<sep>Tom looks like he slept through his alarm clock before the event and flew off the bed, got dressed and ran out of the house without looking in the mirror 😪<sep>Aaawh Tom, you can just wear any shirt 😊<sep>Acho um charme os dentes dele.<br>Esses dentes ultra brancos da moda são ridículos<sep>Woah grandpa. I didn’t realize the decades caught up.<sep>Even Tom didn&#39;t know what the question was<sep>Boo! Who? You. Ooh! Ooh!!<sep>He was asked why are you single Tom, well you just wanna wake up everyday with a different woman, just like you would want to change your shirt everyday <br>Tom your the Man😅<sep>well done. colombo<sep>He’s such a pompous jerk. <br>Arrogance and  control freak.  Small man syndrome.<sep>No bro this content sucks<sep>Evil!!👿<sep>Hey Tom, what day is it today?<br>Tom: &quot;Of course I do my own stunts&quot;<br>And then starts talking about them<sep>VOTE BLUE, ITS FREEDOM FOR ME AND FREEDOM FOR YOU!!🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸<br>GOD BLESS AMERICA🇺🇸<br><br><br>PLEASE, POST YOUR BLUE.  ANY WHERE YOU GO.  ANY BLUE WILL DO..🧢🧢🧢💙💙💙       <br>🫐🫐🫐🥶🥶🥶🔵🔵🔵🔹🔹🔹🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸<sep>Where is the “champion Scientology music” to go with this?<sep>Well if your worth half a billion or more you can afford to change your shirt everyday... Maybe only wear it once Tom. He makes great movies though...<sep>I get it. Some mornings I want to fly my Piper single, other times my Robinson 44. You never know.<sep>😂😂😂😂😂babyyy we dont know each otherrrr<sep>What does?<br><br>What was the question?<br><br>That’s kind of important.<sep>this man makes me want to join Scientology<sep>What a  douche<sep>He looked better with his natural front teeth. Fake always looks FAKE<sep>LedgEND!!<sep>F scientology.... someone needs to disband that cult<sep>Thank God another man that knows how to tie a proper tie ! I was feeling like I was the only one lol double and  triple Windsor  knots look soo much more proper and stylish so can everyone please stop tying the shitty single knot  bc it looks aweful and does not look good  so thank you Tom Cruise for helping me show people the right way to rock a damn tie lol<sep>He looks great. I like that he’s got a tooth in the middle.<sep>I can a little glimpse of Clint Eastwood in Tom<sep>Why is Tom Cruise still a thing?<br>He has become a parody of himself, with his staged comments and exaggerated laughs and crazy Scientology death stare.<br>Im surprised people still havent woken up to the fact he is a fake human being.",0

zotkJwZ9PVY,These are young adults,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zotkJwZ9PVY,"I use to umpire baseball and this one guy was commonly tossed out for swearing at umpires and arguing. Anyways he got beamed in the head one game and got up looked me dead in the eyes and said oh my goodness gracious. And everyone burst out laughing. After the game he came up to me and said you thought I was going to say fuck right your a fucking prick<sep>I immediately thought of the episode where Peter Griffin falls down the stairs<sep>Love Gabriel, love love love 🧡<sep>I am 53 years old and can honestly say that both of my loving parents went to their graves WITHOUT ever hearing me cuss EVER!!! Just out of the respect that I had for my Mom &amp; Dad I just never cussed in front of them! By the way I LOVE YOU Fluffy!!! 🤣😂😅❤️😊<sep>Fun times ! ... 😊👍<sep>I am in my early 30s and still don&#39;t cuss when I am around my family<sep>AAAAGH<br>|_<br>   |_<br>      |_<br>         |_<br>            |_<br>               SON ON A B🤬TCH<br>                <i>____</i><sep>I ask permission to my mom when i cuss<sep>🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂<sep>I’ll see fluffy here in Dallas today again, saw him in Oklahoma same tour. This time my oldest son is coming with us! <br>Worth every dime<sep>Love fluffy I listen to him all the time and at work he makes my night<sep>&quot;You earned that one.&quot; &quot;If you want to say the F word, next time let me push you.&quot; 😆😆😆<sep>i literally heard my mother curse for the first time last year. I&#39;m about to be 47 so for 42 years I never, not once heard her swear. (I know the math doesn&#39;t add up. My folks got me used from the second hand kid store)She was a little tipsy and was telling a story and said the f bomb. I wasn&#39;t the only one shocked because even my siblings had never heard her swear before.<sep>If fluffy and caseoh were to fight<br>Caseoh would eat him<sep>👎👎👎👎👎<sep>Fluffy is the worst stand up comedian. Try to learn from Ismo, Rafi, Trevor Noah etc.<sep>That was funny, and yes, he earned that one.<sep>I didn’t cuss in front of my old man until I was 23.<sep>Im 26. I live alone, but when im at my mama&#39;s home. I wont cuss a single word.<sep>It’s sad that Fluffy isn’t with Frankie’s mom anymore 😢<sep>ROFLMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<sep>this man<sep>1 Cor 15❤33...☪️. I grew up not foul mouthing at home nor around my relatives.  Even today I declined such behavior.<sep>Glad he&#39;s not my dad.<sep>Good parents are underrated and extremely rare.<sep>Your coming to my town😊<sep>How long does it take for comedians of mediocre quality to shut up and stop insulting our culture.<sep>Can someone please tell me why cursing is wrong? Swearing is like hot sauce for language. Censorship is like serving eggs and withholding pepper.<br>Oh, I know where censorship came from.... religion!<sep>I didn&#39;t cuss until I was 16, and my mom hit me with anything she was holding if I did in front of her, while my dad threatened to cut my fingers off over it.<sep>Fluffy u make my day u are so funny May God Bless u  and your family<sep>Just imagine I little 5yr old fluffy in a hero at the bottom of your stairs 😂😂😂<sep>My boys are the same, daddy taught them to respect mama. Daddy was a cop and one son was a Marine so you KNOW how they talk at work!<sep>😂😂😂😂😂<sep>not swear at homer=false virtue. steam must come out. think!<sep>See, that&#39;s the problem with kids today.  Thats why kids are out of control these days, because theres no control at home.  Parents keep letting rap videos and tik-tok raide their kids,  making excuses, saying they can&#39;t control what their kids do away from home.<br><br>ITS CALLED BEING A PARENT.  Don&#39;t teach them that it&#39;s just wrong at home, teach then it&#39;s wrong period.  Whatever it is that&#39;s wrong.  BE AN EXAMPLE, don&#39;t just TELL them it&#39;s wrong.<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopmakingexcuses"">#stopmakingexcuses</a><sep>😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅<sep>There needs to be a Fluffy Bit of this one.😊😊😅😅<sep>Lol love Fluffy.

My kids can swear especially when appreciate it&#39;s like people who refuse to teach kids life skill like cooking or laundry<sep>Wait so the last time you heard your son cuss was when he was 5😂<sep>frankie is 18!???!!<sep>So WHY are you cursing on stage?<sep>Been there... done that!<sep>W dad<sep>I cant wait for this one to be animated (hoping it does)<sep>Come to Birmingham Alabama PLEASE<sep>Tomboys are my weakness 🥰<sep>Saddest part about this guy is that he doesn&#39;t come to my state and it makes me so sad because I&#39;d love to go and see him.<sep>No F word in my house too so good going fluffy I love you for that<sep>😂😂😂 Thanks for making my dau!! @fluffyguy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gabrieliglesias"">#gabrieliglesias</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fluffy"">#Fluffy</a> 😊<sep>Bro caught his son lackin<sep>😂😂 .

myS3A6p5xuA,"Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un Toast to Peace at First Summit in Russia","Kim Jong Un sought Vladimir Putin’s help in resolving a nuclear stalemate with the U.S., asking the Russian leader at their first summit to convey his views to Donald Trump.“Chairman Kim Jong Un himself asked us to inform the American side about his position,” Putin told reporters after more than three hours of talks on a university campus in the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok. “There are no secrets here. We will discuss this with the Americans and our Chinese partners,” said Putin, who is heading to Beijing later Thursday.While Russia extended the invitation to Kim almost a year ago, the North Korean leader only accepted after his second summit with Trump broke down in February without agreements on relief from United Nations sanctions that are choking his economy or steps toward Kim’s disarmament. Since then, North Korea has complained that intermediaries to Trump -- ranging from U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to the South Korean government -- aren’t getting his message across.“I had candid and meaningful talks with Putin on developing friendly relations between North Korea and Russia,” Kim said at a reception with his Russian counterpart after the meetings.For Putin, hosting Kim gives him a chance to remain a player in a security dispute shaped mainly by the U.S. and China. The Russian trip advances Kim’s efforts to break his country’s isolation. After ruling for six years without leaving home, he’s visited five nations since his rapprochement with Trump, including China, Russia, Singapore, Vietnam and a short hop over the South Korean border.Kim, who kept Putin waiting almost a year for the summit, was also more than 30 minutes behind the Russian president’s arrival at the venue. That was an unusual turnabout for Putin, who’s notorious for keeping world leaders waiting for meetings.“We welcome your efforts to develop inter-Korean dialogue and to normalize North Korean and American relations,” Putin told Kim.Neither side released details of what was discussed at the meetings, which appeared cordial. Putin said he shares the U.S. desire to see full denuclearization, but added that North Korea would need security guarantees, most likely international, to protect its sovereignty. He said a return to six-party talks, an arrangement that included Russia and Japan, as well as China, the U.S. and the two Koreas, could be useful for that.Kim, who arrived aboard an armored train Wednesday, hasn’t met with the Russian leader since coming to power in 2011. But ties between Moscow and Pyongyang run deep with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin helping Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, set up the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in the aftermath of World War II.“If the Hanoi summit had gone well, North Korea would not have needed to visit Russia,” said Kim Sung-han, dean of Korea University’s Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul and a former vice minister at the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referring to Kim’s failed meeting with Trump in February.Boxed in by Trump, Kim Jong Un Buys Time With Nod to 2020The Russia trip comes after Kim gave a speech at the country’s rubber-stamp parliament this month where he said he is willing to meet Trump again as long as the U.S. offers acceptable terms for a deal by year end.For North Korea, “Russia doesn’t have the capacity to replace China,” said Kim, the former vice foreign minister. “Internally, it will help Kim show off his leadership to domestic elites but unless the trip generates tangible and physical support, it is just abstract.”Putin suggested a compromise could be possible on North Korean migrant workers in Russia, an important source of income for the Pyongyang government that’s due to be cut off at the end of this year under UN sanctions. He didn’t elaborate, however.“This is essentially a side-show in the continuing saga between Pyongyang and Washington,” Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, wrote on Twitter. “Russia will seek to score diplomatic points by demonstrating its relevance; North Korea, by showing it has options.”Read more: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/kim-seeks-support-from-putin-in-first-summit-amid-trump-tensionSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmTICTOC ON SOCIAL:Follow TicToc on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tictocLike TicToc on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tictocFollow TicToc on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tictocWatch all of TicToc’s videos: https://www.tictoc.video/Listen to TicToc’s podcast: https://apple.co/2D3Vta7Subscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZTicToc by Bloomberg is global news for the life you lead.

If they meant what they are saying, the answer is &quot;Yes, I&#39;m voting for Biden!&quot;<sep>General Milley talking politics? That’s actually not allowed. He really has to give.<sep>Mike Pence: There is no conservative agenda. It&#39;s the billionaire agenda. Not to worry though, if they keep fumbling and fuc&#39;n around with our democracy, their fate will likely be that of Louie and Antoinette of France! 😢 Vigilantes burn mansions, sink yachts, and put boots on air plane landing gear. 😅 Nobody&#39;s safe! 😮<sep>So you 4 say that the US is better off under socialism by Joe Biden &amp; Barack Obama ?<sep>Mike pence, weak<sep>Absolute hypocrites .

You see what you done<sep>Who is trying to create the new world order?  Daniel 7-6.  Self serving don’t you think?<sep>During the first Republican debate, those running were asked, &quot;Would you endorse Trump if he wins the nomination. &quot;  Pense was the last one to raise his arm, and you could see he hesitated doing it.  Pity he was too afraid to hold out.<sep>Trump tried to have you killed Mike Pence.<sep>If it smells like? Not real Republicans.<sep>Pence and these men = Traitor POS&#39;s<sep>Mike pence u suck , u are a Joe Biden clown ,a Disgrace to every American should be held accountable for lies against America<sep>The point is, why are you people ok with one criminal but not the others?

This same people who are taking about Trump’s criminality are worse than anybody you can think of.<sep>( finally! You see , you understand what s going on , finally, boneless pence!)<sep>Name just one good thing Biden has done for America or Americians. Not a made lie.<sep>If any of these men dont Trump are most likely the swamp an afraid Trump will will expose them. Trump has always put America first and they dont like that. The only people that are pushing Socialism or communism so they can stay in control and now the whole country knows it. Biden lied during the debate vs trump in 2020 an Biden hasnt stop lying since. The only people is the left due to they only watchs the fake news. Why is Biden flying so many so many illegal criminal people from other countries? And answer is for votes. If you don&#39;t want Trump to win then you hate America.

They all wanted power and they were willing to lie,cheat and manipulate people to get it. Now as the Trump ship has started to take on water the rats are starting to jump off. With the exception of the former Vice President, the rest of them should be ashamed of themselves and what they did to the country. Vice President Pence saved us from probably having an armed rebellion. He only recently decided to speak out. After all that has happened, we should all be grateful that he put country before his allegiance to the worst president in modern history.<sep>TEXASMUDNECK SAY <br>NO BODY LIKES A TURN<br>COAT!!!! <br>PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED FOR A FORRENIC<br>RECOUNT!!!<br>PITTY PENCE IS MOST <br>REALLY UNDER COVER <br>LIEING DEMO CRIMINALS<sep>He didnt take a stand when it mattered.

He&#39;s a win win  man .<sep>Pence is garbage<sep>Trump dont need you Pence!<sep>It&#39;s about time they stood up to Trump<sep>They say they won’t endorse trump but they never said they wouldn’t vote for him, after all, they’re republicans so it’s party over country for them😡😡😡😡😡<sep>Is Barr kidding? 45 won&#39;t move the country forward? He has been trying with all his might to move us BACKWARD at least 100 years, and all of these men and women were totally on board with it. Now that they have their conservative justices on SCOTUS they are ready to ditch him. Not fooled...<sep>OK MIKE LOL<sep>Most of these people here WILL vote for Trump. Party over country, the republican way...<sep>Don’t get me wrong I appreciate these men but and I say but in the strongest way possible but don’t you think had all of you together with one voice spoke these words while they had a lot more power now they just don’t carry the same weight I’m sorry guys but you guys are the rock that Trumps foundation sits you guys created this thing every time I see and hear your voices my stomach turns right away my mind goes back to the nightmare every day and new lie a new scandal every day since 2016 till this very day this country has been in turmoil even with him not in office it’s like he just came into are lives one day and now won’t leave it’s nauseating and personally I wish you all would just go away that would truly make us great again<sep>Watch out thes poisoned  snakes<sep>You didn&#39;t say a word!! When it mattered!<sep>Do worry Trump doesn&#39;t need these people. He will be looking for the best people and these people aren&#39;t them.<sep>Ouch😂<sep>Dear Mike Pence:  Trump is no conservative.<sep>Maybe he could move to Russia<sep>Go home pencil neck<sep>These people should have spoken up against trump way before now! They should have spoken when they were in office. They were too chicken to do the right thing back then and cared more about their jobs.<sep>TRUMP GAVE EVERYBODY A CHANCE AND THEY STABBED HIM IN THE BACK. NOT ONE OF THEM EVER HAD AN HONEST JOB IN THEIR LIVES, FOR TO GET WHERE THEY ARE NOW, THEY HAD TO BE ON THE TAKE. THEY ARE ALL LIARS, THIEVES AND PROSTITUTES TO BIG MONEY. THE ONLY THING TRUMP DID WRONG WAS TO DO THE LEGAL AMERICAN TAXPAYING VOTER RIGHT.<sep>Mike Pence makes sense.<br>End the slump vote for Trump.<sep>PENCE needs to go away. Criminal.<sep>These are make-believe important people... who are completely irrelevant. <br>🤥🤡👎<sep>Be quiet! RINO traitor<sep>THANKS SIR<sep>A wanna be dictator that supports dictator Biden and the invasion of our border. Calling Trump a dictator. Lol...<sep>THANK YOU ALL ! FOR STANDING UP. FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND COUNTRY! 🇺🇸👏<sep>Easy to see the Farce is with him.<sep>That&#39;s just too g*<b>***</b> bad. Because we&#39;re not voting for any use son of a b****&#39;s.<sep>If this is real, then Republicans are acting like fools<sep>Weasels and rhinos all<sep>Pence...a dollar light, but kudos for showing up.<sep>Well Mr Esper Brandon and all democrats fail on every point you’ve stated.<sep>Trump is  A winner for our country not these cry baby losers....<sep>Pence is a ignorant jerk<sep>People who want the shallow trappings of pride and image are ok with Trump ... aka ... (Don-nocchio). People who really got to know him ....can&#39;t stand him. Many preserved their character by getting away from him or resigning.<sep>Remember... Trump was 4 years of everyday chaos and hell with a tax cuts for the rich, and 1.2 .million dying of COVID. Vast amounts of his time was spent fighting legal battles. Little got done for the little guy.<sep>These are all back stabing loosers that only got in the spotlight and recognized on President Trumps coat  tail.<sep>No worries. Never expected corrupt Democrats &amp; Rino&#39;s to endorse President Trump.  He has the endorsement from MILLIONS of citizens.  GOD bless America. GOD bless President Trump.  MAGA Trump 2024.<sep>This is the problem with pence and all those people who were in trump administration they have a choice right now show the American citizens that they believe in our constitution and our democracy are they patriots and are they willing to speak out against trump or are they going to not vote to do that is to dishonor those who have sacrifices their life for our democracy and freedom.",0
9OvibwfflDg,Inside Sofía Vergara’s Stunning Los Angeles Home | Open Door | Architectural Digest,"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by Sofía Vergara to tour her stunning home in Los Angeles. The ‘Griselda’ star had quite a challenge on her hands when first acquiring her palatial Beverly Park mansion–according to her, it resembled a castle you might find in Transylvania. But with the expert help of interior designer, Ohara Davies-Gaetano, Vergara’s home was transformed into a Mediterranean paradise in the heart of California. Ornate European touches fill the space, from an 18th-century French limestone fireplace to baroque antiques placed beneath a 19th-century Italian chandelier. Vergara’s home truly does transport you to the luxurious rivieras of Europe and makes a perfect sanctuary to enjoy for years to come. “My friends from Colombia find any excuse to visit. There’s just something about this place that makes guests want to stay. It’s special. I still wake up every day thinking, I can’t believe this is my life.”See more of Sofía Vergara's stunning home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-sofia-vergaras-personal-la-paradiseShop Sofía Vergara’s home style!https://www.architecturaldigest.com/shopping/sofia-vergara-open-doorWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.Closet Organized by Linda Koopersmith @beverlyhillsorganizerWant even more AD?

It’s not very trendy at all. A few elements here or there. Her personality is so loud, and even her personal style so her house is the opposite of what I would’ve expected.<sep>❤❤❤<sep>I LOVED everything!!!!!!!❤❤❤<sep>Beautiful Vibe in the house just like hers ❤✨️✨️✨️🌺<sep>CASTLE IN TRANSILVANIA ARE HORRIFFIC? SWEETIE I LOVE YOU BUT DON.T CROSS THE LINE<sep>Sofia have one of the most lux big house. Villas or 5 stars hotel standard.

Real chefs do it way better than me anyways<sep>i dunno why but that point when she said she does not cook and doesn&#39;t wanna learn how to cook but her son is ironically great at it, makes me think she&#39;s a great mum.<sep>Only one word about the house. “Sterile”<sep>Vem das barracas e querem ser rainhas..nem cozinhar sabe??!😮😅<sep>Please bring more varied profiles! It’s about time to get more musicians here!<br>My suggestions are Lars Ulrich, Mark Ronson or Chad Smith 🤘🏼🤩🎸<sep>Oh my goodness, what a stunning house.

You pretend to be a peacemaker in the case of the Russian and Ukraine wars but cause atrocities and genocide against the people of Palestine... Your actions demonstrate a clear disregard for human life and international law. You claim to be a champion of democracy yet ignore the cries of the oppressed. Your words ring hollow and your actions speak louder than words. Your administration&#39;s policies have caused immense suffering for the Palestinian people, yet you remain silent. You are a disgrace to humanity. You have no moral authority to speak on peace or justice. Your actions speak louder than words.<sep>Dear jb,<br>For the purpose of getting re-elected, now is time to declare that a Lion (America) is no longer accepting the stupid claim of a Cockroach (Israel -maker of only ineffective war products of bombs in Russian failed strategy of the dark ages) to be good friends [f e r e n d h s].<br>Today&#39;s reality is: for the deaths of less than 500 Jews in the hands of stupid Arabic &#39;jihadist heaven goers&#39;, the dumbest ever PM of Israel has killed another 1000+Jews and 1000+ Arabs in a few days.<br>Therefore, this dumd PM must be treated as another war-criminal just like Putin+ and need to be tried for all his War Crimes in the name of protecting the Jews. He has proved himself as another terrorist in disguise.<br>He is so ignorant to understand that there will be no further wars and in a month&#39;s time, all will end in a grand fiasco for this stupid PM and his Jewish backers including the Jew affiliated congressmen inside political arena of USA!<br>Wise folks know, the Arab-Jew issue was created by: UK (Britain&#39;s old politicians of past century were the dishonestly motivated) -the historially known evil mastermind of all these bloodsheds including this time in 2023.<br><br>They got away in the past but, in 21st century&#39;s electronically inter-connected, transparent world of quick awareness, any such evil leadership connot evade facing the deserved justice served in front of the closely watching eyes of global citizens. <br>If for any reason, justice is not properly served, the perpetrators will be object of hatred by the majority of the upcoming generations.<br>-----------<br>When you have hot-tempered-idiot(s){elected by religiously-blind-xenophobics/dogmatics} as heads of states or minority groups, what better of revengeful consequences, ones with sane minds, can expect? .....<br>.... inspired by some idiotic, religious dogmas; and actually having not enough wisdom to understand the humanity or knowing nothing about &#39;the never-to become discoverable&#39; game of Cosmic-creator, the stupid war of destructions shall only be fueling more hatred and anger for the next generations of Arab and Jews.<br><br><b>**</b><br>*International communities of billions of global citizens have enough of their own issues to deal with, therefore, in their eyes, this 2023 Arab-Israeli events of bloodsheding is nothing more than repeated shows of barbaric actions and reactions of two minority groups (like Rohingas of Myanmar, Kashmiri group of India etc.).<br><br><b>**</b><br>The dumb Islamic heads and insanely hot-tempered Jewish  incumbents (e.g. Nitanyahoo and his backers) are heinously too dumb to create further ongoing and decade-long hostilities towards each other&#39;s religiously blind groups&#39; by these idiotic bombings and insanely committing acts of destructions in rage -where only the ordinary citizens and professional or the jobless, naive, recruited fighters (part of the present humanity) are suffering and dying.<br>Should begin sooner than later, the process of generating awareness for bringing both the &#39;small minded angry and dumbly revengeful Leaderships&#39; of &quot;Arab and Israeli racial groups of minorities&quot; to the open stage in front of global citizens and international court of public justice for committing crimes against humanity.<br>-Recommended impartially to all (including pleading to unfathomable CC) by HGP Foundation of the new age.<sep>Instead of making the lives of Americans better, free healthcare, free education, lower taxes, prices, Biden is spending billions on a senseless war.  Because in this war, rich people in power are getting richer.  Now, if, for example, Russia placed its military equipment on the border with the United States in Mexico, I am sure a war between the United States and Mexico would begin, just like Putin protects his borders from NATO.  A good politician is one who foresees the consequences.<sep>Russia is winning the war. We are losing. Ukraine has been destroyed and will not exist soon. All thanks to this yahoo and his administration of neocons disguised as democrats.<sep>Putin dont think too much of you bumbling Biden.<br>You may want to look at that now that have drug America into Russias war!!<br>There are more Americans leaving America since you have taken office and dismantled American democracy!!<sep>Joe is a mafia boss cleaning out Ukraine.

The U.S bastards are responsible for these acts, the west looks like its fighting to spread the loss of moral sense to the whole world and it created a new cold war.

He ruled Kyiv from the year 980 to 1015, launching major building projects, pulling together divided tribes and introducing Christianity. Today, he&#39;s honored with a soaring statue in Kyiv overlooking the Dnipro River that bisects the city.<br>Yet Russia also claims him as central to its political and religious history. They know him by the Russian version of his name — Vladimir the Great. Six years ago, Russia built an even larger statue just outside the Kremlin walls.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYRCEIcDAE"">https://youtu.be/tZYRCEIcDAE</a><sep>Whaaaaaat?

My country had already done 3rd shot already..<sep>Get er done, Joe. Ignore the naysayers. It&#39;s a tough time. Economic forces that have been building since early in the Trump administration is what&#39;s driving inflation and such. Everyone conveniently forgets the thousands, and in some family cases more than ten thousand free dollars handed out. Simply supply and demand economics. More money in circulation, the less each dollar is worth. If the US printed $50 trillion right now, the dollar would devalue substantially and inflation would spiral out of control. Housing prices are being driven by lumber, copper, millennials being the largest home buying group now, and a massive shortage in housing starts 10 years ago bc of the market collapse. The pendulum has swung the other way. People want low mtg rates and low/predictable home price growth. The free market. When it&#39;s truly free market economics, worse things will happen. If the Fed didn&#39;t artificially control it with interest rate changes, we would see even greater peaks and valleys. People don&#39;t want a free market. They want a predictable one. And a free market is anything but 100% predictable<sep>WOW, I`m impressed. Could`ve pumped a whole bucket for this and the next year as well.<sep>Why do it take he so long????

When the officers of  a Police Department gather a sufficient evidence,that a criminal activity occured  they are OBLIGED by operation of law to act. The same is also the StPO( Strafprozessordnung ) in Germany where I reside.   Actually, in my opinion on 06.01. you STLL had immunity,because the nomination of President Biden happened on 21.01.2021.  How the honorable Judge Tanya Chutkan will decided about the &quot;classified &quot;documents depends on HER intepretation of the  words&quot; IF DISCLOSED&quot;. This is a requirement  of Art. 3 US <a href=""http://constutution.as/"">Constutution.As</a> long as there was not a transition of power, the  the defeated  President enjoys immunity. YOU OUGHT TO STUDY THE US CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS, dear Presidente Trump!<sep>Eu assisti novamente, eu gostei muito mais de assistir agora, do que antes.<sep>Oh-Look , a Clown.<sep>Hey, trump,  why don&#39;t you give yourself up, and save hard earned money taxpayers some money?<sep>Thank you so much<sep>Everyone Vote in 2024<sep>TRUMP 2024<sep>MAGA 2024<sep>THIS CHANNEL SUPPORTS D.J.

I hope I can Text you and our Friends there 😊<sep>As much as i try, i cannot disagree with this man.<sep>Contrary to what is now stated by Trump, the number one threat to the nation from the time of the Trump administration until present day, is White Supremacist Extremism (WSE). This has been stated by Trump&#39;s own head of DHS, Chad Wolf. It is really sad to watch gullible people refuse to learn their lessons in repeatedly putting their faith in somebody who exploits them, and lies to them. If you are reading this, *look it up*,  and don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t warned about his lies.<sep>❤❤❤ wish all the best mister president you are our hope in the world 🌎<sep>Bring him back<sep>There he is!  Our president Donald J. Trump!!! We love you!<sep>Man i hope he gets in but cause if this all the judges and prosecutors are gonna unfairly go even harder on him!!! <br>Its so corrupt!!!<sep>thats why they wanna put him in jail...they know if he gets elected its over for these people<sep>AMEN! Get rid of the GODLESS COMMIES and CORRUPT FREEMASONS. GET RID OF EVERYONE IN CONGRESS AND THE FBI, CIA, DOJ etc...BRING BACK TRUMP!!! TRUMP IS THE ONLY WAY.<sep>FYI: On December 14, 2022, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. issued a proclamation, proclaiming, December 15, 2022, to be “Bill Of Rights Day”. Therein he constructively asserts that the act of enshrining “fundamental freedoms” in a “Bill of Rights” (first ten amendments) , was an act of codification, transferring to government (executive branch) the power, legal right, or authority to interpret, reinterpret, apply, enforce and declare the law as it pertains to the original 10 amendments (“fundamental freedoms”), effectively enabling new forms of expansive state action, without regard for &quot;certain unalienable Rights&quot; endowed to the People by their Creator.<sep>Fairness and equality under the law, wouldn’t that be great. So would enforcement of our immigration laws. Come back and end our border crisis 🙏🇺🇸🙏<sep>I love president TRUMP 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Your late for your manicure Donald<sep>Thank you, for wiew like &quot;you&quot; ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤one more please.❤<sep>You got what is going on &quot;MR 45...thank you, to you.❤hi is on live❤live, wide at open...MORE.🗽🇺🇸🗽🇺🇸🗽🇺🇸🗽👍<sep>Trump 2024!<sep>our country needs Trump again.<sep>Always good, Mr Trump.<sep>DJT   ONLY you can !!<sep>God bless DJ Trump --- gods speed save our country !!!!!!!<sep>Lovely<sep>Trump people just can&#39;t  get it, basically  what Trump did was walk into their homes find the paperwork for the security system, the code for the system, where they keep their guns how to enter their house how many people are in the house and when they come and go all their schedules what valuables  they had the codes to all their safes and then went out and gave everyone he could this information. And then when you asked for the information and paperwork back he lies to you and tells you he doesn&#39;t  have it forcing you to get the police to come and get your property back from him, and then he tells your friends and family your the crook those was you paperwork and you illegally  had the cops take them from you. And you friend believe him because they are just like you trump supporters. Now if they won&#39;t accept this from someone who enters their personal home then why are they accepting this from a person who entered the white house the people&#39;s house that protects us all collectively  as a nation.<sep>We love you Commander and Chief! 🇨🇦<sep>TERRORISTS.  JOE BIDEN, DNC, GOP,  ISRAEL &amp; UKRAINE:   HAVE DECLARED HOLY WAR! ON CHRISTIANS WORLDWIDE..  YOU KNOW! IT IS TRUE!<sep>So, what is Marxism again?<sep>Thank you for protecting me trumpy...seraphim angel..shi...always there for you my friend..<sep>❤<sep>About time someone spoke out against injustice from those sworn to uphold the law!<sep>End Qualified immunity for police, all the 3 letter agencies, prosecutors, government officials, and judges so that they must make decisions that they are able to be held accountable for. This will reform our legal justice system.<sep>Get rid of any teachers that push this crap also.<sep>I agree 100% with this guy. Trump 2024!<sep>Its clear he just wants to go after d ppl investigating &amp; prosecuting him.    Ain&#39;t gonna work cuz this crooked orange clown is NOT gonna get elected ever again<sep>This crook is clearly gonna  weaponize d govt to go after his &quot;enemies&quot;. Evidence of Impeachment right here.<sep>No one better suited to be our president #1<sep>BAN Soros from conducting any and all influence and financial business in The United States of America‼️🙏✝️🇺🇸<sep>I was way better off under your presidency.  This guy biden is a freakin&#39; horror.<sep>Necessary.<sep>Get that scumbags Mr. President<sep>❤ Looking forward to it! 🎉<br>🌟 CIC, President Trump ✨<sep>I’m so glad it’s all coming out. Now we have to clean house and return our great President TRUMP. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸<sep>👂👂 👍<sep>Uma Bíblia em cada lar americano<sep>He won... Thank you Mr President. But now it&#39;s time to vote for a president who won&#39;t allow the slaughter of helpless humans in their wombs put there by their creator.<br>As we see the world falling apart, curruption everywhere, the signs of the times are accelerating, Child sex trafficking, child sacrifice to the devil and the connection between the two by slaughtering helpless humans in the womb and rewarding mothers for killing their own instead of helping mothers find a home for their developing child inside them...Jesus said when you see these things, those who trust in him, should stay alert and be watching, praying for his return! Acts chapter 1, 2, 3<br> Come Lord Jesus the Savior of the world 🕊️ revelation chapter 1, 19, 20, 21, 22<sep>We support you from El Paso Texas Mr President!<sep>We support you Mr President from El Paso Texas!<sep>Why not deal with the vile Soros himself? When his own country declares him an Enemy of the State, surely there must be grounds for investigation into this creatures activities!<sep>+ compound interests. Thank you Sir !<sep>TRUMP 2024<sep>President Trump America needs you back so much! Voting for you again for the 3rd time and praying we can have a honest election and not stolen again ,for the sake of America.God protect you and your family ✌️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸. Trump 2024 🇺🇸🇺🇸<sep>It definitely does need to be reformed.. my life experience can testify the lack of justice.. I say vote for Trump he&#39;s the only one that seems to be tuned to the humanitarian vibe does american needs.  And we do not expect him to be perfect. As he is doing an excellent job and how&#39;s that for his track record.<sep>The only problem I see with all these problems your promising to fix, is that it takes time. As you know all these problems didn&#39;t just start overnight or in a four year term. It&#39;s a snow ball effect, these problems started decades ago and have just been building because no one put their foot down to all the problems we have now days. So my point being is that I don&#39;t think even if you get another term, that you will have enough time to fix said problems. I&#39;m assuming it will take many terms to fix America. The only way to do that is to assure that either you have time to fix the problems or to make sure that following presidents continue with trying to fix America and not break it.<sep>Let’s get to work<sep>Great to see you back on YouTube Mr. President. 🇺🇸🇨🇦🇺🇸🇨🇦<sep>Your BACK, FIGHTING the RIGHTEOUS WARRIORS WAY🇺🇲✝️🇮🇱.<br>MAY JESUSCHRIST SPEEEEED🤴<br>GREAT JOB BOSSMAN⛳️................🏌‍♂️🇺🇲<sep>Holding people accountable I see that happening with you now 😂😂<sep>Democracy promotes the greatest liar to the highest office &amp; violent mob rule on the street.<sep>Trump is the biggest psyop in history.<sep>I thought he was gonna make us great. Shut it old man.<sep>Good luck man<sep>I will say good luck for Trump and to really keep his eyes open for the worst. Those dangerous people that want to rob our lives are still there and are definitely hoping to plot another attempt against our election. Also I will be there to vote strongly.<br>Also very good job for still standing even though I did originally wanted Ted Cruse as president back when it was 2016<sep>Yes Canada has a terrible crime wave now too and the Conservatives keep blaming Trudeau specifically but obviously he&#39;s not personally the lawyers and judges making horrible decisions some of them should be disbarred at minimum.<sep>If Trump deports or arrests all the marxists, I&#39;ll carve his face on Mount Rushmore myself.<sep>Our country wont make it to the next election at this rate<sep>This is our problem in my city SA, Texas. We have a District Attorney, &quot;Let &#39;Em Go Joe&quot; is literally his mock name, Joe Gonzales, because he&#39;s instituted &quot;cite and release&quot; aka &quot;catch and release&quot; policies. Since 2019 this program has started the increase in crime and downslide of our quality of living. When criminals are not prosecuted, they grow bold. We&#39;ve seen it in our neighborhoods, as they are actively trying to change the environment into one they are comfortable with: chaos. With disorder comes the idea that no one cares, and anything is allowed. We&#39;ve watched it on our front and back streets, drug traffickers, drug mules, drug addicted, preying on the actual homeless and creating more homeless in the process. Because &quot;non-violent offenses&quot; which include drug trafficking arrests where no violence occurred are turned away by the DA&#39;s office (factual information from multiple police officers), the drug dealers are out the door before evidence is even fully processed, back on the streets and free to continue with what they were doing. What this has done is demoralize police officers from even attempting to arrest, ticket, cite, and in many cases the criminal who&#39;s committed a misdemeanor (even with eye witness testimony and video), may not even be talked to. This is not hyperbole. This is information gathered from the neighborhoods through actually talking to people, as well as attending different Neighborhood Associations. This has to stop. It&#39;s akin to allowing children that have no impulse control, to push boundaries, and not be corrected other than verbally, but no action taken and no &quot;teeth&quot; behind the correction.<sep>You have a Lot of Work ahead of you cleaning out the Communists 🚽<br>Thank you God for sending President Trump 🇺🇲🙏",0

It is not permissible to publish your music. It is the sin of everyone who heard it. Please delete it. It is also not permissible to show the private parts, the private parts from the navel to the knee. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, commanded us to cover the private parts, so my brother, cover your private parts. May God reward you with good.  Just as backbiting is not permissible. They said, O Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, what is backbiting?  The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said, “Remind your brother of something that he hates. Therefore, brother, anything you mention, comment on, or speak to people or make comments, and from these words you know that none of what he hates is backbiting. This is backbiting. Therefore, it is best to ask for forgiveness and forgiveness from that person so that no retaliation is done.”  From you on the Day of Resurrection, and as you know that we did not guarantee ourselves, let alone someone comes who takes good deeds coldly and without effort, so the rights must be returned to their owners. It is not permissible to publish music for you. It is the fault of everyone who heard it. It is also not permissible to publish things about infidels or wear their shirts or imitate them, whether a football player.  Or an actor, because this involves glorifying them, boasting, and being loyal to them, and we as Muslims only take pride in our Prophet Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, by following his Sunnah and spreading it, and the Companions and the Mothers of the Believers, may God be pleased with them all. It is also not permissible to qaz’a because the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, forbade us from doing that, and it is not permissible to shave the beard because the Prophet  May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, we never shave it just as it is not permissible to photograph people without their permission and publish things about them without permission. You must ask for permission and then publish whatever you want. It is not permissible to expose the sinner, but rather he must be covered and not exposed. This can be either by commenting or by publishing something or publications in which the person in the video is a sinful person.  Therefore, by publishing, commenting, liking, or anything that spreads more video, you contribute to exposing it more, and so on. Therefore, please delete any comment or like that you made for a video that contains sin, whatever it may be, because they are ongoing sins. Drawing and cartoon pictures are not permissible because they emulate the creation of God Almighty, and it is not permissible to publish them.  Pictures or videos containing women are the sin of everyone who looks at them, and all of this, or any sin, the person must cover himself and not expose himself, whether he goes out to people with them or tells people that he did such and such, because it is openly committing sin, and the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, forbade that and said, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.  All of my nation is safe, except those who speak out, and we are all wrong and negligent. The Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, commanded us to forbid evil and enjoin what is right. The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said, “Whoever among you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand, and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue, and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart, and that is the weakest of faith, so you will say that you did not do it.”  With some of the sins that I spoke about, but my brother or sister, with the presence of many sins while I was working on the phone, and God guides us all, I cannot send to someone every time because there are different sins, and therefore I collected them in complete lines, and God is your helper, so I advise you to repent and start with myself and return to God and cover the soul, and God is my brother, death.  It will come suddenly. Likewise, every disobedience must be followed by repentance until we meet God. Remove these things that do not please God Almighty. Prayers and peace be upon the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace..........<sep>😂😂😂😂😂<sep>🥹🙌🏻🙌🏻<sep>I miss you too much my friends all the very best to you<sep>Steroid abuser talking about s draft doger!!

WOW 😂😅<sep>Honestly cgi doesn&#39;t come close<sep>Thanks to you and everyone with you for every bit of memories you gave me and gave my family. 🤞❤<sep>👍​<sep>He is a big legend🤣👑<sep>You have to be very special to play mr bean, virtous actor...you 👏👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰<sep>&quot;Because it was <b>POP</b> cheaper&quot;<br><br>XD<sep>Can he please do nature documentaries!!!! He&#39;s oozes royalty with that voice and accent<sep>That car scene was one of the most iconic of my childhood<sep>I love Mr. Bean<sep>OMG, that&#39;s been one of my all-time favourite Mr Bean episodes<sep><b>remember the intro where he falls into the circle of light?</b><br><br>“It’s cheaper to just… do it.”<sep>That skit will never NOT be funny. I can&#39;t imagine CGI being able to replicate that.<sep>Rowan is a treasure. God, this is gonna hurt when that sad day comes.<sep>Mr Atkinson. Very smart, very accomplished in his field. Well played Sir<sep>Even now CGI doesn’t look as good as the real thing<sep>Be prepared to stand on one&#39;s head if the cameramen pulls the break.<sep>&quot;In those days we used to do things for feal because it was <br><br><b>POP</b><br><br>cheaper&quot;<sep>Those were the days , my friend, we thought they&#39;d never end<sep>Mr bean ❤❤❤<sep>Very fun i expect<sep>Why did they never explained in Mr Bean that he was from another planet 🤔<sep>Racecar driver, electrical engineer, writer, actor, the man is an all around genius<sep>“Not allowed to do it anymore”, there’s a reason post 08 content degrades so massively<br>And this seems like one of the excuses for it, not allowed to film cheaply and do it well, have to use expensive cgi for every shot which means you have to get funded by a bigger studio which means your intellectual hold on your work is degraded and they insert their own messaging at the cost of the film<sep>Dude is an engineer actor, the finest along side Jackie Chan, Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks<sep>This man was my childhood, what i would give to meet rowan, hes such a legend in film<sep>Makes me think about jackie chan and him doing all his stunts not people today they sit infont of a green screen<sep>i feel like rowan atkinson is not appreciated enough<sep>Hands down one of the funniest skits ive ever seen.<br>First time i watched it i was laughing and crying the whole scene. Genius<sep>CGI is garbage and needs to be stopped!!<sep>LMAO. He sounded so disappointed not being able to hit the cameraman. 😂<sep>THAT WAS MY DREAM CAR AT A POINT<sep>❤😊😂<sep>I always wondered if he still has the green mini😂<sep>Not a bad word about you in the comments Rowan . You truly are in a special club ❤❤❤<sep>The legend<sep>His Voice sound rare that anybody&#39;s has, it&#39;s so soothing, so cool, so calm, so decent,so perfect, Precious like a gold🥰👌😇<sep>What a great voice of MR bean.<sep>Breaks failure is as common as meteorite strike in the middle of the day. 😂<sep>👏👏👏<sep>Who else laughed at the last scene and mumbled &quot;I remembered that&quot;.<sep>So funny you’re comedy still makes laugh<sep>Why is he so cool, and his voice😍😍😍<sep>It&#39;s ironic that a man with such an amazing voice made his fortune through silent comedy<sep>love this<sep>He speaks so little on screen but he has a beautiful voice😊<sep>🙏🏽♥️😊💕LIEBEN DANK , MR. BEAN<sep>Ich denke, es gibt wohl ganz sicher NIEMANDEN, der oder die über so viel Witz, Humor, Spaß nicht prustend LACHEN KANN. DANKE ! 💕<sep>I saw the dentist episode for the first time the other day and asked me exact these questions. Cool thing I found thist short within the same week.😅<sep>Rowan Atkinson is a Legend. We love him!<sep>Wait, did he really drove a car sitting on a sofa on top of it? I always thought that someone else was driving the car.<sep>Love him<sep>He has such an amazing, sophisticated voice and yet he’s mostly known for a character that barely spoke. 😂<sep>Dude Netflix should do a rerun of all his shows episode.. My favourite one was the thanksgiving episode with the turkey head and all..<sep>B<sep>BRB &#39; Love !<sep>He&#39;s yet another legend who made our childhood a better place to live in ❤<sep>This man took control of an airplane after the pilot died of a heart attack and successfully landed. While I have heard it was a bit traumatizing for him, this guy is a stone cold legend. But, like, a hilarious legend.<sep>my mum cracked up laughin when mr bean got behind the ambulance when the siren on the ambulance was on and he followed it til it got to the hospital she couldnt stop laughin me too ha ha<sep>The reason why over the decades, people are still watching Mr Bean and not the CGI heavy movies<sep>Mr bean!!!<sep>Curiosity is a password: Open sesame😅<sep>&quot;In those days, we tended to do things for real because it was <b>pop</b> cheaper.&quot;<sep>This scene of Mr. Bean driving the Mini Cooper on the top of the car is amazing.<sep>Big like ❤<sep>I really like him as a person and as others already mentioned, he has a nice voice and way of talking 👍 <br>I grew up with that purple, red, blue,... VHS cassettes from Mr bean 😅 <br>but later also liked the older stuff he did with that comedy ensemble in the 70s. Pretty basic, black humor and for some people clumsy awkward stuff, but I could shout out all day long 😂<br>For sure (!) he changed the western world of media and comedy a little bit and <br>it still feels like he doesn&#39;t get enough credit 😕<sep>A man with such deep and sexy voice, yet his biggest work is him acting silent!<sep>I always thought what if the mop/stick slipped off the pedal<sep>The cheaper, the riskier. Thus says Mr bin .. oh mr bean 😅<sep>Für minute 20.09 der name seines &quot; Dings&quot; ist &#39;Herz&#39;<sep>I expected him just to make faces. 1st hear him talk<sep>I see a lot of people here wishing back these real stunts, but they seem to forget the implications. <br>Even if for every 100 mister beans driving towards the camera only one doesn&#39;t stop in time, <br>that&#39;s one guy who won&#39;t come back to their family, <br>just for our entertainment.<sep>You will be missed 😢 R.I.P legend<sep>So he actually did that stunt? 😮<sep>Kinda blows Tom Cruise out of the water doesn&#39;t he? 🤘🤘🤘<sep>“Amymore”<sep>Those days were better. Bring it back<sep>This person made an entire generation laugh without saying a word❤️<sep>It&#39;s all good - cameramen are immortal 🤔😳🤩😆<sep>Thx to ai we can  hear him speak now<sep>The man himself. 👉👉👉👏👏👏<sep>And they wonder why today&#39;s cinema is on down fall.😂<sep>Teddy<sep>I&#39;m so in love with him<sep>Mr Bean is Jackie Chan&#39;s twin<sep>I remember watching that years ago oh my gosh that was one of the funniest Mr Bean episodes ever<sep>He is so eloquent.<sep>I remember Rowan setting the top gear lap time record. He&#39;s a natural born driver<sep>😂 So did they actually paint his apartment with a firework in a paint can?<sep>The cameraman never dies<sep>Mr Bean was a problem solver,loved watching as a kid,helps you to overcome life&#39;s obstacles,a valuable lesson that would serve the gen xers these days.<sep>this is a rip off of a grate french french comedian mr hulot&#39;s holiday played by the funny  acques Tatii would call it plagiarism<sep>He rides a pitch black steed!<sep>Tv in those days was sponsored by Nike THEY JUST DID IT! 😉<sep>&quot;In those days&quot; are the golden words here.. 😊<sep>How did they get insured??????",0
x_P-0I6sAck,Governor Schwarzenegger's Message Following this Week's Attack on the Capitol,"This is my message to my fellow Americans and my friends around the world after January 6, 2021.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_P-0I6sAck,"I would have never showed up there to protest honestly. That&#39;s not something I would have done. However Trump&#39;s going to get lower gas prices in Trump has some better policies. I&#39;m sorry we got to talk to him and make sure he comes down and stops talking so much crap on people and with the hate and the anger and that&#39;s it other than that I think he&#39;s a good president<sep>I just don&#39;t think anyone should be pointing fingers until we know for sure. Because Trump definitely did not call for a riot. Trump peace and they were supposed to be a peaceful protest according to what Trump said there is literally no evidence to suggest otherwise buried the people trying to break into capital what&#39;s the different situation. Why would Trump want and then to go in there like a bunch of loons? I don&#39;t believe that for one second I&#39;m sorry but I have a hard time believing that you believe that. I mean Trump does a lot of things that are good at however he has a lot of contention which is not good. I&#39;m not convinced the whole thing isn&#39;t just a show. However I&#39;m going to vote for Trump. I&#39;m not sorry I just am. I&#39;m not worried about climate change, I do like having clean air I do think air pollution is a problem however I&#39;m not driving an electric car unless there is 0% chance that it can catch on fire or be operated remotely. 0% chance at all. The transgenderism stuff I&#39;m sorry that has to stop that has to be banned and I know that&#39;s what the founding fathers would want and I know they would want abortion to be banned. At the time I think abortion was just an unthinkable act and so they probably didn&#39;t think to put it in there and it&#39;s probably covered under natural rights or being the right to be born and the right to life. The founding fathers were called of God and that is what God would have put in the Constitution<sep>And I don&#39;t think that it was Trump that practiced it in the third world countries I really don&#39;t I think that was other people<sep>Also don&#39;t think they were trying to overturn the Constitution. I think they were trying to save the constitution.<br><br>Really the whole thing seems like a big show to me. I agree with most things you say but I mean this video is a little weird I&#39;m sorry<sep>Also don&#39;t think they were trying to overturn the Constitution. I think they were trying to save the constitution.<sep>I would like to challenge your Catholic faith also lol, you just have to look at how Jesus organized his church. He organized it with Peter James and John at the top and he had 12 Apostles. The Catholics tried to adopt Christianity however that&#39;s the thing they tried they didn&#39;t actually do what Jesus said to do and they&#39;re not organized in the way Jesus organized his church. Jesus didn&#39;t have popes and and nuns and things like that. The Roman Catholics were trying the Lord reinstated his church through the Prophet Joseph smith. In the Church of Jesus Christ over 2000 years ago the Lord chose Ordinary People to leave his church and he still chooses Ordinary People to lead his church. Does it call on popes and nuns and things that sort of separate themselves from the rest of the people<sep>There&#39;s no way to blame it on Trump Trump definitely said that he said that they are peacefully and patriotically making their voices heard. From what I can tell he wanted peace<sep>I&#39;m not convinced that he was trying to overturn the election results. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with challenging election results if there was fraudulent activity. I just don&#39;t just like I don&#39;t see a problem when I go talk to HR when I feel like I&#39;m being harassed at my job and they&#39;re making it hard for me to do my job. They just got mad at me for complaining and they claim that it&#39;s my fault because I&#39;m the one that has a problem when it&#39;s not my fault I have to deal with a lot of angry people that like to be angry and hit things and throw things and be angry for no reason and I just don&#39;t want to deal with it I just need everybody to be happy and do their job so I can do my job. I&#39;m sorry I have to disagree with you I agree with you on most things but the Commandment is to judge not that you be not judged and condemned not that you be not condemned. That is what Jesus said. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s safe to say that Donald Trump was trying to overturn a fair election unless that&#39;s something that he said he was doing because he says he is challenging fraudulence election results and you think about how many people vote in this country there&#39;s bound to be some fraudulent activity. There&#39;s just no way it was a perfect election. And I&#39;m not even convinced the whole thing isn&#39;t just a show anyway honestly. Maybe Trump is just acting it out and so is the Democrats and it&#39;s all a big show. I don&#39;t know I really don&#39;t know but I have to go with what Jesus said and to judge not and condemned not<sep>Obviously what happened there was totally absurd and they should not have done that. I think they feared the mob and tried to make it clear and let them in. However I don&#39;t believe that Donald Trump&#39;s fault I don&#39;t believe that he wanted them to do that. However what is very suspicious to me is that in Ecuador and then Peru and then Chile and then in america. In that exact order. First of mob burned down the country&#39;s capital building in Ecuador the government knew it was coming and they changed cities and the mayor had to block the city off with military trucks. Then the same thing happened in Peru and then Chile. I know because I was dating a girl from Ecuador at the time and she told me all about it and then she showed me the videos. So I don&#39;t believe that it was a random event either it was definitely practiced in third world countries before they did it in America<br><br>Of course that&#39;s could be just Satan stop but it seems like some pretty rich people that have the money to do that first they did it in third world countries in South America and then they did it in America<sep>Arnold you will regret making this video. <br>HISTORY WILL PROVE YOU WRONG.<sep>2020 was not a fair election.<br>WE HAVE PROOF NOW !!<sep>Talk about what blm and antifa did after Trump became president. THEY ATTACKED THE CAPITAL AND BURNED WASHINGTON….<br>How about the bombings of the capitol by democrats.<sep>Very well said... Thanks.<sep>So tell me Arnold, who is the worst President?

EVEN THOUGH I DON&#39;T AGREE, BECAUSE I SUSPECT BIDEN HAD REALLY BAD DECISION AND UNJUST PERFERENCE IN HIS PRESIDENCY. I ALSO WITNESS THE DECLINED IN DIVERSITY OF CONSEQUENCES IN REAL WORLD OF USA IN THESE YEARS. IT WOULD BE LIKE PAINFUL AND ASHAMED TO LET THE NEGATIVITY EXTEND. MR SCHWARZENEGGER&#39;S PERFERENCE SHOULD HAD REASONS, BUT, MY COMMENT AS A MICRO WORLD OF USA REFLECTION TO WHERE MR SCHWARZENEGGER THE MACRO WORLD VIEWS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD, MY LITTLE COMMENT HOPE MR SCHWARZENEGGER WILL NOT MIND, AND PLEASE REVIEW THE SELECTION BECAUSE SIR, MR SCHWARZENEGGER&#39;S MACRO SELECTION WOULD IMAPCT THE DESTINY OF USA AND THE WORLD.<sep><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rfkjr2024"">#Rfkjr2024</a><br><br>Arnold Schwarzenegger for Secretary <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23arnoldschwarzenegger"">#ArnoldSchwarzenegger</a><sep>It&#39;s absolutely insane to me that these people can claim to be &quot;patriots&quot; and &quot;real Americans&quot; while actively contravening the principles upon which the U.S.A. was founded. <br>They pontificate endlessly about the constitution - but they&#39;ve never even read it (nor read anything else, for that matter).<br>They incessantly evoke the &quot;founding fathers&quot; - but couldn&#39;t name a single policy or idea espoused by any of them. <br>They mindlessly scream about electoral fraud while physically, violently attempting to illegally manipulate the election results. <br>And most ludicrously of all, they constantly allude to their politically-expedient and vulgar interpretation of Christianity even though the separation of church and state was a <i>fundamental</i> concept upon which the nation was established.<br><br>If you <i>truly</i> &quot;loved&quot; your country, you&#39;d embrace change. You&#39;d accept that the majority of your fellow countrymen believe that a man like Trump is completely and utterly undeserving of power. But no, things didn&#39;t go your way and instead of actually loving your country and saying &quot;Ok, that&#39;s what the majority of voters want for this country, so let&#39;s do it!&quot;, you&#39;re throwing a childish tantrum because you can&#39;t accept that other Americans think and feel differently to you.<br><br>So really, these seditious buffoons aren&#39;t patriots <i>at all</i> - they&#39;re willing goons for a rich, pampered man who has never worked a day in his life, and who wouldn&#39;t think twice about fleecing and extorting them in every possible way were he given the opportunity to do so. Imagine betraying your country for someone like <i>that</i> - it&#39;s hard to think of many things more pathetic, quite frankly. Perhaps those unbelievably ridiculous proclamations that Trump is &quot;God&#39;s chosen&quot; and that Obama/Biden is the Antichrist 😂<sep>i love tacos<sep>Thanks Arnold.<sep>He is right Trump is a bad guy, but Biden is too. We are one missed up nation, but we will still stand. I wish we could have someone better than Trump or Biden. I think Biden is still worse for the economy and our freedom. That is the only reason I would  vote Trump. He is slightly better, but still bad.<sep>I thank you for doing this - and ask that you are as vocal as you can be in the next few months. Your voice is heard more than most - and I am glad that you aren&#39;t afraid to use it.<sep>.i love you and this speech<sep>Do you still think you are right today 😂???<sep>Does it means what ever  president Biden plan to do we should support him unconditionally?? 😢 is it democracy?? Really??<sep>Indecision 2024, people must see this<sep>This didn’t age well. The democrats were the ones who set the Jan 6th actions up. <br>Trump 2024.

At least Trump didn&#39;t order the military to kill anyone. What about George W. Bush and the Iraq war?

The good news is he will be soon be as irrelevant as an old tweet.&quot; <br><br>Stirring, patriotic and entirely appropriate remarks throughout this speech. Alas, this &quot;good news&quot; of Trump&#39;s irrelevance has not yet materialized. How &quot;soon&quot; is &quot;soon&quot;? Not soon enough. A sad commentary on the GOP&#39;s weakness and spinelessness that they still kowtow to Trump, putting him in position to be the party&#39;s nominee this summer.<sep>After all the George Floyd riots.

Kristallnacht Is such a BS comparison to J6.<sep>This is laughable.  Jan. 6 was a mild riot.  People entered and mostly took pictures and selfies.  Some windows got broken, oh no!  Guess what?  We the people own that building and every other government building!  They belong to us!  We pay for them!  That election was absolutely fraudulent!  The Biden administration is the most incompetent and corrupt in our history!  So some people who simply questioned the results of that election and gathered to to express their frustration are equated to murdering Nazis?  Only one person was murdered that day, her name is Ashli Babbitt.  An Airforce veteran.

B431TaVozPQ,Xi: China Is Ready to Be a Partner and Friend of the US,"Chinese President Xi Jinping talks about the bilateral relations between the world's two-largest economies.

They would like nothing more than to see us implode from within.<sep>@pamelaiken<br>0 seconds ago<br>Censorship, no elections, no civil liberties and it&#39;s against the law to speak publicly  in public  about  xi in China.  people go to prison and are never seen again.  who cares if he speaks English or not he is not someone to be trusted when it comes to of course democracy. He would like to see it crushed just like every autocratic regime would.  I hope the American people are paying attention and don&#39;t vote bi- partisan ;vote for democracy and that means you can&#39;t vote for Trump. I&#39;m not a fan of Biden and I&#39;m not a fan of Trump but I&#39;m voting for democracy. I wish the American people weren&#39;t so stupid because that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. The mass majority of people that are  supporting Trump are unfortunately people that make under 50 or 40,000 a year have very little education.  these kinds of minds are easily twisted and easily duped until it&#39;s too late; then they&#39;re gonna be the first ones screaming their heads off about living in a totalitarian regime, and it will be to no avail.<sep>China and U.S cannot be friends, because the people look different and have different cultures, they should go their own way<sep>Yes, friends with American business, friends with American people, but nit friends with the Republicans,  Democrats, and the White House.<sep>Bless China always<sep>I love you xixi<sep>Bahahaha, Xi just told china to prepare for war. Lies lies and more lies<sep>Xing ping Winnie the pooh 😂<sep>Traydor. Do not trust China.<sep>Crazy how they send a balloon spy on us and threaten our ally Taiwan, then decide to “make peace” seems like a big scheme to get our trust and backstab the U.S.<sep>Says one thing and does another at your back.

Indeed U.S and China relations have come to the table that both are sharing equal &quot;common interest&quot;. By observing Israel-Hamas wars situations, we know that NATO and BRICS are no longer competitors. NATO supports Democracy, whereas BRICS supports Dictatorship. Both NATO and BRICS have their own Oil Supplier and Military Business target market.

SCS bullying.<br><br>Stop war mongering  in SCS<sep>Hmmm…. Remember fentanyl,  threats to invade Taiwan, military base build up in Philippines  territory,  9 dash line dismissed by Communist Party of China,  the new 10 dash line- that’s even worse, Uyghur  detention center, Falange Gong organ harvesting while still alive, 2,000,000 military soldiers,   Inhumane treatment of Hing Kong protesters,  massacre  of University students at  Tiananmen   Square,   stealing of  American patents,  copyrights worth billions of dollars.  The United States must truly  focus on making this national smarter. Many families are stressed out financially.  It seems, by design, housing which is a basic need is no longer available to sell to home owners.  Big private investors are outbidding families and also paying cash.  Family units must be secured.   New jobs must be invented if  and when AI takes over millions of jobs, from teachers to journalists.   The generation that are supposed to start families  will face a new reality and might even think twice  to have kids which will depopulate the US. Which is happening now on many countries that have a strong middle class.   China May have to face its own problems internally. Reestablishing friendship with the US seems to imply that China government  is clueless  with the global reality’s distancing themselves from them.   There’s going to be a new China on the horizon, and I hope it’s going to transcend peacefully for Chinese citizens’ sake.<sep>I have concerns with  phrases like “…not interfere with China’s affair.”  The Chinese  9 dash line that claims other countries national boundaries  falls under the phrase,  “not interfere with  CCP China’s affair” even though The Hague Ruling, an international court which CCP  China is a member of, did not agree with the 9 dash line. <br><br>Xi must respect other countries’ national borders, and their EEZ.<sep>His face is puffy.   By the way,  please respect the Philippine fishermen.  Respect countries like the Philippines.  Practice what you say publicly.<sep>Asian summet law puntahan nyo ang loson vesaya mindanao sabah para makausap ang manga trebo trebo sa pilipinas kong naebegay ang total budjet sa pamelya ng manga trebo trebo united nation pls help pls help at ibat ibang bansa see senyor amen pate kayong manga nagtratrabaho sa panginoon sa pamahalaan amen<sep>I totally agree i love china i think china and the us should be best friends forever ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲<sep>China and the us should All ways be friends forever ❤❤❤❤🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲<sep>你是否认为对种族灭绝和奴隶制视而不见是可以的?<sep>Can Biden at least give it a shot?<sep>We love president Xi in America.<sep>I got $500,000,000 from Alonzo Cantu ..<sep>I send a prayer of peace light and love to all of China.

Continue with original idea to empower Mexico. Lend the Mexicans the money to manufacture and undercut everything we import .. “ made in china” start chipping away at the marble columns. No shipping costs etc and it weakens a military that subtly arms to match us . Do the same thing with India. Keep driving down Chinese exports.  <br>There may come a time where that power is useful … economics beat Russia china is an economic powerhouse. Lets see what can be done to reign that in a bit . Id ask all allied nations the US protects and is partnered with to support the transition from Chinese economy to Mexican and indian . <br>Send their growing military a message… <br>It makes sense anyway to support Mexico, half the US has Mexican blood .

I binge watched it all. great.!<sep>She was in london ???<sep>Ok ! But she is beautiful, sexy and elegant.<sep>Sofia is amazing! Also, check out her interview with AD if you haven’t. 😉<sep>Love, love, love her. She is so talented.<sep>Hello boys cool speek<sep>stunning and incredibly beautiful !!!<sep>We love Sofia in the UK . Sofia is an Icon ❤️❤️❤️❤️<sep>I didn’t know that after all these deaths, cocaine is something to laugh about<sep>I always loved her sense of humor.<sep>UGH SHE is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stunning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no puedo , love SOfia<sep>Plz drain me 😍<sep>She is awesome in Griselda. Loved it! Also noticed she was the producer of the show.<sep>🖤<sep>It&#39;s nice to see an actress appreciate where she started and not go &quot;oh don&#39;t want to go there&quot; with Sofia &amp; Modern Family.<sep>As a Colombian I loved her performance and the fact that it was done in spanish most of the time which is how it happened...as Colombians, we speak Spanish when others around us also speak it and we never would talk between ourselves in english knowing that no one that speak only english is there... I think it would have been even better if they used all of the actors from their original countries and not Mexicans or others acting like Colombians or other nationalities...it takes off the authenticity of the story, specially when there are dialogues that require that nuance that only a native can give. In Narcos, the worst mistake was putting a Brazilian actor to play Pablo Escobar (and then a Mexican and a Venezuelan to play the Rodriguez brothers plus an Argentinian to play Pacho Herrera, who also polays Griselda&#39;s husband, someone from Medellin, not from Argentina!) as it ruined the whole thing for Colombians and other Latin-Americans that know how a Colombian from Medellin sounds and express himself...In Griselda this was avoided in great part thanks to Sofia&#39;s interpretation, but there is still work to do in future productions where there is a biopic or a story with a specific regional emphasis. This is something that has to be fixed as it is not only inaccurate, but also is an insult to the people that these series represent and portrait...<sep>Sofia&#39;s is one of those women whose persona and presence alone... just stops a room.<sep>😘 Her wardrobe 🌹...WOW!!! I LOVE THIS DIAMOND CLASSY LADY...SHE IS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL...👏🙌☝👍💪🙏😇🙏 GOD BLESS HER FOREVER...🙏😇🙏<sep>Absolutely stunning beautiful woman and should get an award for Griselda was amazing<sep>Just finished watching Griselda, she is excellent in it<sep>her performance was fantastic. she was like an entirely different person. phenomenal series!<sep>Omg that billboard is right next to my uni<sep>When I am with you I do not need to be introduced to anyone else. Girls have fought for me back in the day you know... Sofia, Little Sofia, I feel a connection, I really do. Kiss Sofia<sep>Fuck, Sofia, fuck.... no can do. Too much emotions, passion as they say.<sep>I know you. This is just the thing, you are so beautiful and charming. I do not want to be just friends. Sorry, no can do. :( 🧡💛💚<sep>I want to make love with you, is that a Crime? Sofia, beautiful name.<sep>I am 43 you are probably younger. You are so sexy and beautiful, but you need to be with me for a few days. We will do normal stuff, and while you are sleeping I will navigate your body. I want to listen to you and hold you baby.<sep>Sofia is one of the most smart actress in Hollywood ever.<sep>Pick up boys. What the... You are hungry. You have had all kinds of procedures done but I find you sexually attractive. This guy in the other hand does not get picked up, MEANING ME. Come to Finland closer to the summer, I will gladly show you around. Lying again, I can not do that. I watch you but not.... If you are with me only then I can help.

None of us are innocent.<sep>I don’t like or support Trump in any way but he is correct to call this guy out.<sep>I honestly think foreign affairs would be better with him, like last time.

bQdX1kpcArI,Could you stop Ronaldo from scoring a goal?!,"Can you imagine how hard it is to stop Ronaldo from scoring a goal? I used to play soccer. Let me tell you-- it’s almost impossible. But the Iranian team just did the impossible. To the Iranian people I say: You showed courage on the playing field and today you showed the same courage in the streets of Iran. Iran has many problems-- air pollution, water scarcity, billions wasted on terror. Can you imagine what would happen if the Iranian government, instead of wasting your money in Syria, in Yemen and unnecessary wars in the Middle East, would start investing it in solving these problems in Iran? The solution to all these problems is the Iranian people. That’s why I offered medical aid to save Iranian lives after a devastating earthquake. That’s why I opened a Farsi Telegram group to teach water conservation to Iranian farmers. And that’s why I’ll never stop advocating for peace with the Iranian people. One day I hope to watch Iran’s soccer team go head-to-head against Israel in a free Tehran. On that day, we’ll all be winners.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQdX1kpcArI,"Just like the billions you spend on terror and killing children you filthy liar.

It says it right there on the box. The Magnus is a pistol.<sep>oi how  did you all know who the hell this broad is? In Australia we still get podcasts from the Post Office on CDs...<sep>- Now, Jingle...<br>...did you tell the other elves<br>   on March 14th<br>That Chris was magic?<br>-No Ma&#39;am, I did not.<br>-You never, not once<br>-No Ma&#39;am.<br>-WHAAAAAAAAT???<br><br>😆<sep>Welp its nov 3rd. Time to start watching all my favorite xmas clips episodes and movies for the next seven weeks<sep>ahhahahahahhahahahaha!!!!<br>this is perfect!!!<br>just amazing!!<sep>I particurly appreciate that Santa has that poppy, degraded audio quality which is an acoustic signature of seemingly every key witness on serial- like he&#39;s speaking aggressively into a walky talky in the middle of the woods.<sep>This is so good.<sep>This is a Global Tel*Link prepaid call from — Adnan Syed — an inmate at a Maryland correctional facility<sep>The attention to detail and effort to nail the podcast exactly is amazing. Even his lawyer?😂😂😂😂<sep>You can hear the Serial fans in the audience just laughing at the accuracy of Cecily&#39;s impression.<sep>I listened to Serial 5 years ago in an English class.  I still come back to this skit because it is so accurate.  Brings back memories, especially the music.<sep>well done<sep>i fucking love this hahahaha<sep>this sketch is amazing in many levels ... Good job!<sep>This is by far the best SNL skit<sep>Absolutely hilarious<sep>If you wanna make sense of Santa, you could say that the Christmas Magic actually slows the whole world down over Christmas night, rather than making him go fast. He’s moving at regular pace but the world is super slowed down. He told me himself<sep>❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣<sep>Kids today don&#39;t know how much this sketch &#39;hit&#39;. SO GOOD. 🙏<sep>This was perfection!!  Glad he is out now!!!<sep>Still one of my favorite skits everrrrrr.<sep>The “Righ…..you know what I mean” ? Classic Sarah!<sep>Petition to cast Cecily in Only Murders in the Building 🙋‍♂️<sep>I just listened to Serial last month. If I had seen this 7 years ago, I wouldn&#39;t understand why this funny! But it is dead on!!<sep>No one is gonna mention the MailChimp reference at the end? So perfect<sep>Laraine Newman sent me. She has my thanks - this is perfect!<sep>What a brilliant parody. Cecily Strong, you will be missed on SNL!!<sep>This is brilliant on so many levels.  WOW.<sep>This is a great example of a skit where you need to have seen the thing it’s spoofing in order to find it funny.<sep>The intonation of the line, &quot;the horse wouldn&#39;t even fly&quot;.  Brilliance.  I will so miss Cecily Strong on SNL.  Looking forward to everything else she does.  🌟<sep>BAHAHAHAHA 😂🤣😺 Love this skit!!<sep>This skit sucks, they removed the Robert Goulet skit from the Christmas special for this?<sep>This was one of the more genius sketches SNL has put out. That generation IMHO is sooo underrated. They weren&#39;t goofballs like the 90s early 2000s SNL, they had really excellent writing<sep>She sounds exactly like the actual lady<sep>Lmfaooo the Adnan impersonation is spot on 😅🤣😅🤣<sep>That starting music makes me get real attentive and ready to listen to Sarah Koenig, and the details of the case put together neatly. Boy I just started Serial few days back after Adnan&#39;s release, and here I am watching all the videos related to him. I guess all 100s of videos have been made on this case, and documentaries, many have made money of this case, not that its bad or criminal to do it, im just saying. But the families that sunk into grief were Hae and her family, Adnan and his family.<sep>Cecily Strong is one of the most underrated SNL cast members of all time<sep>Outstanding<sep>Watching this to feel something<sep>Good lord! Now that I&#39;m finally listening to the original season of &quot;Serial,&quot; I can get how brilliant this piece is. The nailed EVERYTHING. Maybe Cecil&#39;s finest work.<sep>I like how Santa says “Know what I’m sayin”<sep>Very good. This reminds me of the Portlandia episode where Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein do a story for NPR. Hilarious. Perfection.<sep>i hope Adnan gets to see this now that hes free lol.<sep>The theme songs still sounds like Mr Beans theme song.<sep>34th Street... I get it.<sep>Kris be like that<sep>Who’s here after adman’s out<sep>Adnan is home 9/20/2022🎉<sep>Here cause Syed was just free with conviction overturned<sep>who&#39;s here on 9/19/22<sep>Here on 9/19/22 for reasons 😊<sep>I&#39;m touched by the thoughtfulness of protecting the helper elf&#39;s identity with a face blur. 💓💖<sep>so fucking funny ☠️<sep>Judging from the small amount of laughs, not many in the audience had listened to the Serial podcast... but if you have, this sketch is really, really funny!<sep>I&#39;m having flashbacks to AP English class in highschool 😂😂😂 we listened to this podcast for like 2 straight years<sep>There were probably a lot of people who didn’t fully appreciate this but anyone who has heard season 1 of the Serial podcast will truly appreciate how spookily accurate this is. Every single detail is spot on.<sep>geniuss<sep>Yo, this is god-tier parody... like straight up perfection<sep>I can&#39;t believe I just found this. The first season of Serial is my favourite podcast of all time; I have so many memories of roadtrips listening (and relistening) to Sarah. I&#39;ve listened to season 1 at least 4 times!<sep>Hilarious. Imagine Adnan watching this.<sep>Absolutely nailed it!!!<sep>That would be fucken terrifying putting it into a legistical realistic sense a fat dude pushing 300 minimum and 12 800+ lb raindeer land on your  roof which is unless its a helipad wont hopd up structurally he then breaks into the house who throughout the year watches you while you sleeping<sep>SNL is dead.<sep>One of two sketches done with Kyle that are funny.<sep>Love the pseudo jailhouse calls...<sep>I fee like there is a strong nod to Tannis ;D<sep>Portlandia, version. Better<sep>Nice rack.<sep>Thank you for honoring my deep hatred of podcasts. Lol<sep>While I&#39;m familiar with what Serial is and the nature of what they covered in their first season, I&#39;ve never actually listened to it. But I have devoured Only Murders In The Building---and their theme music is so similar to theme music SNL plays here--is that a rip-off of Serial&#39;s theme music?<sep>isnt this the same song in the amazon series &quot;only murders in the building&quot;???<sep>Lol.  The phrasing, tones are  perfect.<sep>Vai Corinthians<sep>Cecile is phenomenal!<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATXbJjuZqbc&amp;t=271"">4:31</a> loved the subtle reference to the Christmas movie Miracle on 34th Street<sep>They got gigs haahhahaha how did everyone miss this<sep>Christmas magic<sep>🤣🤣🤣🤣<sep>Oh! I love ceilcy&#39;s voice😍<sep>The DOP for this was spot on.<sep>I had never heard of Serial until I watched this - after totally binging the podcast I had to come rewatch to see how close it was. Everyone did an amazing job!<sep>Downright one of tbe best sketches done. The Nisha call / Mailkimp 🤣🤣🤣<sep>Wait why didn’t she contact the cops?<sep>God bless Dr.Umoru on YouTube who cured me totally from HSV-2 with his effective herbal supplements.<sep>the best<sep>That theme song though<sep>literally every aspect of this was impeccable<sep>Just throwing in my comment to make it 1000.<sep>One of my professors in a sociolinguistics class at college actually played this when we were discussing vocal fry/creaky voice<sep>The fucking court drawings LMAO<sep>Bahahahahahahahahahaha love it<sep>This is amazing.

We are half communists anyway, another half to go.<sep>We Loved him.<sep>we were allies with the soviets out of necessity and quite honestly it is a stain on our country.<sep>Did he cheat? Yup. Was he still good at his job? Exceptionally!<sep>Sure they can be friends, but ww2 wasnt one of those cases, any political relations which have a positive effect on both countries do not mean that both countries r friends, an ally is not your friend merely your business partner.<sep>Won by the greatest election landslide in history,  but his enemies (the ones that got the Kennedy brothers) got rid of him.<sep>..... said the man who broke every law in politics.<sep>Now replace &quot;Russians and Americans&quot; with &quot;Iranians and Israelis&quot;. You will hopefully get some secret geopolitics lesson<sep>When the U.S were really presidential, professional and intimidating.<sep>He was a pretty smart guy. The poison pill was his dogmatic embrace of the Red Scare nonsense.<sep>They&#39;re supposed to be managing a country        not stuffing their pockets<sep>Once upon a time when Republicans were adults.<sep>Keep your friends close and your enemies closer<sep>It&#39;s mad how a load of people can think a man who commited treason is good because he read a line that was given to him<sep>Funny how he wound up be president much later than his former opponent, Kennedy.<sep>Of course they have different goals! Russians are not trying to steal everyone else&#39;s resources all the time!<sep>As time goes on he looks a Statesman that the world could do with now,<sep>Communism ideology is being pushed by certain people in the government.  They are just using different terminology.  You have seen a massive change in media, schools, psychology, and redefining words to help push the agenda.<sep>The United States didn&#39;t give a shit about WW2 until they were attacked by Japan. Also they and the Soviets were not allies, they were merely not enemies, after all the US and the other allies didn&#39;t intervene when the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east.<sep>It&#39;s weird how former presidents sound reasonable and understanding. Yet a total tool when in office.<sep>Obiden is Anti-American, incompetent and the head of his &quot;family of organized criminals.&quot; He is in cahoots with communists in China, Russia.... He should be prosecuted!<sep>When Russians are friends, it means they are accumulating forces for an attack<sep>It’s true. Look at the current war of Russia in Ukraine and USA &amp; Israel in Palestine<sep>Mr. Nixon was perhaps the greatest US president since the World War II, he revived us from disasters from Korean and Vienna wars, set up US dollars dominance in the world, build coalition with China leading to the demise of Soviet Union.<sep>He was so brutally bullied, teased, and ridiculed in his life. It’s nice to see. He’s having something of the second life on the Internet thanks to our current batch of incompetent politicians.<sep>patton the ww2 hero was dead in Europe.  If US never turn up, France and Brit may not be around. Nixon playing nuetral.<sep>So the governments are the problem....stemming from the governments not caring about the goals of their people.<sep>PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE ,POLITICIANS GENERALLY &quot; RATS&quot;.<sep>The Hegelian dialectic .. control both sides....and pretend to be enemies....<sep>WW2 was started by TWO NATIONS - Germans and Russians together split Poland(Russians got more territory). Germany since 1945 had their repentance, but Russians - had NO repentance and they continue warmongering and aggression around their borders.<sep>Stop with the ai generated<sep>Weird how Communists want us to think that while not actually believing that themselves. Funnier still is how if you change communist to socialist then it suddenly becomes so intolerable that we can’t even say the actual groups name.<sep>Back in his day America had morals and Russia didn&#39;t. Now, Russia has subverted and demoralized America to the point I don&#39;t recognize it any more.<sep>He was a threat to their scam as is Trump.<sep>said the man who made the war on drugs<sep>Wow!  A President that can actually talk with a point.<sep>Don&#39;t worry Mr president ..Mr Putin will turn america to Disney land soon...no need to worry about anything else<sep>as we can see communism is just the excuse for usa<sep>Nixon totally threw South Vietnam under the bus.<sep>I like the first line. &quot;We have to understand the world as it is&quot;. That being said, the soviet union is gone, and the baseline humanitarian rights that were being ignored by the USSR, have since been corrected by the Federation of Russia.... if we seriously treat them like soviets, we will undoubtedly begin to repeat history.... <br><br>Again. We have to understand the world as it is.<sep>Nixon was a pretty underrated president.  He got thrown under the bus for the watergate thing, but honestly the last few presidents have done a lot worse things than him.<sep>best president we ever had in the 20th century<sep>He served during WW2. Standards are long gone in the West....<sep>I&#39;m starting to think he was framed.<sep>Yes this true but we the USA is a communist country now <br>So now we can be fo<sep>Sold out to China,what a douchebag!!<sep>They weren&#39;t Russian, they hated Russians<sep>King double tax federel bank 😮😊😊😊😊irs fbi tax<sep>Watergate today would pale in comparison to the shit that gies on in Washington today. Eisenhower didn&#39;t trust him, but Nixon was no idiot...<sep>Imagine that.  Nixon being the voice of reason.  Now only if our “democratically elected leaders” would get their heads outta their asses and pay attention.<sep>Nixon is definitely in the bottom 5 as president if not the worst president ever.  But he is in the top 5 of former presidents after office.  He did so much for the country once he left office it’s insane.  It’s sad that more people do not realize everything he did for this country.<sep>We forgot how the world works.<sep>He basically built China as it is today. <br>He coined the phrase &quot;A New World Order...&quot; in a speech about China.<sep>Russia is part of the global south unlike America<sep>Pushed out by the communist democrat globalists..<sep>Now we have China Joe and his pals in the swamp selling us out to the communists.<sep>one dumb thing Nixon did was allow China into WTO, and that&#39;s how everything went to shit.<sep>Red army abused all those behind the curtain. Terribly!<sep>This is the man that started the war on drugs, dont be brainwashed hes done far more harm than any cold war has<sep>As an American, Im starting to like Russia more than the US.<sep>And they say the same thing about us and thus this problem exists<sep>Biden: What is the flavor of my Ice cream?<sep>putin asking to join nato 8 years until realizes that nato built to destroy Russia<sep>Americans think everyone is like them and wants to conquer and control. Always been paranoid. The Russians dont care about the US. They care about their own interests.<sep>Why must Russia have your best interest?<sep>America is Zionist and works against its own people.<sep>A better president than most, this man could think, unlike many sorry leaders of today.<sep>Dude was talking about the Soviet Union and people in the comments still transpose that to modern Russia<sep>Idiotic president<sep>Why, why, why did the west fund Lenin and the communist revolution in Russia? Don&#39;t listen to this old liar and see the truth<sep>People then:<br><br>People today: &quot;If you bought a cat that was breed in Russia your an enemy!&quot;<sep>Yes he did, but he drew up in a time when people had integrity.  They acted like responsible adults,   not Drama Queens.  Like some leaders are today. 😊😊<sep>Putin wanted to be a friend of the USA but the USA isn&#39;t interested in friendship.<sep>This is something Trump does not understand<sep>Bolshevists quietly infiltrated and siezed control of the US in 1902 after Mickenly was removed, I&#39;m not as familiar with Russian timelines, but they were also taken over by the Bolshevists. This is what has led to the century of our press, banks and political situations, such as why we joined both WW&#39;s, why the majority know only a false recreation of these events, why our money lost it&#39;s backing, the Fed and income tax being established, 911, why we funded the Red Army during the early years of the 2nd war, why we have so heavily funded the Ukraine debacle, why we are currently funding WW3, on and on.<sep>But Biden, evidently, likes the ways of the communist world.  So, how can we get him deported to Russia where he belongs?????<sep>Deepfake?<sep>Russia and America was no friends in ww2 there had a common enemy that&#39;s all<sep>I see a Red face over a &quot;WHITE&quot; shirt!!! Indoctrination is Hell.<sep>Do you think people would be able to make governments friends to each other ?<sep>Wow..theyre fleeing to where they are from...so Israel aint their homeland afterall. And after Israel safe y&#39;all return likenits nothin. Guess who dont hv the luxury of returnin....<sep>Free Mason<sep>Like they&#39;re still communist. Silly Americans<sep>Wow who would think Nixon could speak such truth<sep>He was a wrongdoer ❤ He could not realize politics!!! ❤ He was a jocker❤<sep>Nowadays american are confused with there pronounce, they don&#39;t kno<sep>Its easy for that Friendship<br>but only if you remove Zionist Jews.<br>They are masters to make twin brothers hate and kill each other<sep>He isn&#39;t saying a damn thing here. He&#39;s only being articulate, unlike Dumb Donald and Uncle Joe.<br><br>Plus unlike Trump he isn&#39;t lying with every breath talking about himself, so I can see why Trump people are so blown away.<sep>Indeed there&#39;s a bit of contrast when your mission is ideally that of givining to everyone fair chances to live a satisfying life and without nefarious interferences but of course police is always that problem...<br>And then there are these folks that destroys everything, strip resources, money, wealth from the whole world, impose their corrupt ideology and pretend to be democratic but they are actually a tyranny, especially given their historical kill count. All for the sake of capitalism and their money.<br>How can the Soviets and Americans could have got along? In the end, as obvious as it is, Americans destroyed them too, as they destroy whatever and whoever do not agreed with them. The only way to be on their side is just be their serves. And then they call it &quot;freedom&quot;. 😑<sep>&quot;I am not a crook&quot;....lol<sep>Neither do we have theirs.<sep>Makes a lot of sense!<sep>He acts so much like Trump. It’s crazy. They are too wonderful reasons for sterilization.<sep>No one can be friends with Americans backstabbers...<sep>He&#39;s not really saying anything groundbreaking<sep>The original tear-down target of the liberal media.  Its just hat they were ashamed to be as open about it, in the alliance with the stupid Demorat voters of the time, as now.<sep>😃 HAVE A NICE DAY ✌️🤥✌️<sep>The only difference is our language. I have met lots of Russian dudes. They are very conservative.<sep>U know, the MAGA goals of establishing an AUTHORITARIAN OLIGARCHY in our country makes them more like RUSSIA than we should allow.",0

He is a war criminal who is trying to rehabilitate his image. He has ruined the lives of countless ukranians (and russians) and the rest of world has only been destabilised by his war. The Hitler Award of the year still goes to Netanyahu for his genocidal intent and unimaginably cold brutality, but Putin is still a strong candidate. Of course the US also has indirect responsibility, but evoking anti-western sentiment to raise support and make excuses for brutal, destructive action is pure manipulation. We need no such leaders, be it in Russia or in the West or anywhere.<sep>Nato and American aggression must stop. The Nazi Ukrainian government is a puppet regime installed by an American backed coup in 2014. If NATO, America and Ukraine stopped breaking accords and agreements Russia would go home.

However, many people are falling for a different trap by accusing the Jews of acting like Nazi Germany when the media is trying to make it look like the Jews were in the wrong, when they weren&#39;t actually in the wrong. Iran&#39;s proxy Hamas attacked first.<sep>Zivjela Rusija.  Do pobjede Predsjednice ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Look at them eyes.   Lol🎉🎉🎉<sep>Ridiculous Whataboutism<sep>Ah right he didn´t start the war by sending 220.000 troops into Ukraine lol<sep>Putin’s not lying like our president<sep>Coup or not a coup, Ukrainians wanted with Europe. Russia didn’t agree to that. That’s about it.<sep>This person I believes  his own lies",0

Thank you for providing &quot;The People&quot; a paved road to not be afraid to openly question and discuss what is taking place and presented around them! Truth be told, I myself could not watch &quot;Get Out!&quot; in it&#39;s entirety given how close to home it hits with me, a multi heritage African Hispanic Commonwealther (Shh . . . Australian-Canadian) German American. Hit close to home for me being that it appeared that someone was utilizing a super computer that of Big Black and not Big Blue of a HALVE BLACK Prototype notion of being able to reduce or increase the flow of fluid dynamics or fluid mechanics of people in their everyday interactions with each other. Utilizing this HALVE BLACK Prototype System that, &quot;Johnson Controls&quot; of Kelly Johnson to circumnavigate my life of prosperity away from from me and onto others, only to them suggests it actually being a result of my own doing! Really! I, myself would use such a super computer to demise my own life in success! Ahhh . . . The story that stinks like a skunk isn&#39;t over yet . . . For what do we do? &quot;We Work . . .

BBXXRjpw6LE,Cazzie David’s Guide to Getting Over a Breakup | Sad Hot Girls | Vogue,"Going through a breakup? Follow Cazzie David’s eight-week program and you may end up receiving a text back. Director Mayan Toledano and Orian BarkiFashion Editor Alexandra GurvitchHair Adam MarkarianMakeup Virginia YoungProp Stylist Javier IrigoyenManicure Eri HandaSound Tim Race, Thump StudiosEditor Mischa AlettaHow long does it take to get over a difficult breakup? According to Cazzie David, the answer could be as short as eight weeks, if you’re willing to go to extreme lengths. The actress and co-creator of YouTube series Eighty-Sixed devised an eight-week recovery program three years ago after things ended somewhat abruptly with an ex-boyfriend. The first and most important step in her action plan will sound relatively familiar: Cease all communication with your ex (no texting!). The rest of her advice?

Really really bad genes would not touch with a wooden stick lol.<sep>6&#39;1&quot; and 113 pounds... I don&#39;t think thats even possible... he would be a skeleton... Pretty sure she meant 213 pounds.<sep>thots front-load all their fun in youth, and pay it off in never-ending installments of loneliness in old age. <br>better stock up on cats. <br>after 40, it&#39;s a long sad journey to the grave.<sep>Should have called me... I don&#39;t cheat.<sep>Omg<sep>What&#39;s actually sad is that Karley Sciortino has a boyfriend, and it isn&#39;t me.<sep>Why would anyone want someone else when they got YOU?  I bet making love to you could set the bed on fire and  there would be  no need to put it out!<sep>she look like a dude<sep>I love the sad girl stories<sep>Slutever, slutevah? What is it?<sep>The old &quot;i might be a monk someday trick&quot;. Works everytime.<sep>Her legs are incredible<sep>Where is her integrity? I get that some women would stay and play along with a delusional monogamous relationship, but why are we glorifying it? I bet she was a nervous insecure wreak throughout the entire relationship and that’s nothing to be proud of. Putting on her bf’s side chick’s underwear is a step back for female empowerment and not something to be celebrated. It’s says that she is willing to give her power away and do anything to be a good girl and please her man. Sad....<sep>i feel a sense of self acceptance after watching these videos... its ok to have naive moments or moments where you feel stupid and ashamed  because these things can happen to anyone at any time!<sep>Hamilton Morris?<sep>or is that all women fuch the same man!... ¿do you know his surnames?<sep>Is &quot;Max&quot; Hamilton?<sep>Does anyone else think it odd and depressing not only that she made herself believe her boyfriend wasn’t cheating when it was clear he was but that she stayed with him for two more years?????<sep>Call dream taxpayer complete bean eye everyone existence urge.<sep>The editing and photography of this video is cheesy<sep>This idiot makes sidechicks look like the good guy!<sep>Is this what dating is now?<sep>Can Vogue just, not?<sep>This is a good woman.<sep>I love her<sep>that&#39;s a man<sep>Vogue, can you be vogue again?<sep>Umm... too much information<sep>Vogue,what has happened to the standards Who approves these? Please get back to your earlier standards or stop vlogging.<sep>Male dandelion haha<sep>O M G<sep>I can&#39;t believe this content is on Vogue. The producer should be fired!! What sort of message is this giving to women but how stupid does she look saying it. I have less insecurities than her, kick him too the curb, how gullible are you?? That&#39;s disgusting, wearing other people undies especially some slut&#39;s!!!!<sep>6&#39;1 and 130 pounds and mystery tiny panties. they were his. hes a soy boy (google it)<sep>Vogue? Is that you?<sep>Why did they have to sexualize this??? Being cheated on is hurtful. Not sexy. Try again<sep>Absolutely loved Karley in &quot;Easy&quot;. Really enjoyed this season :) good job!<sep>WTF did I just watch. O.O<sep>u really like to dumb yourselves down with pointless dribble?<sep>Please stop this<sep>What the shit? And what happened after? I love these stories man!!! Jesus.<sep>If he was 113 pounds Then they were probably his....<sep>The relationship lasted two and a half years... wow.<sep>Do lele ponss<sep>Hey girl, I just saw your episode on Easy season 2<sep><b>Am I the only one who is obsessed with this channel?</b><sep>Actually this is not stupid. That is true. Sometimes women want the guy to be &#39;the one&#39; so much that they make themselves believe anything but betrayal (at least I know I do so). It&#39;s not because she was naive or stupid. It&#39;s because she was in love.<sep>the only thing sad about this story is her pathetic excuse for self worth....this is beneath you Vogue<sep>The fuck? 😶 By far the stupidest shit ever made/said/done. And to think she wore a stranger&#39;s undies. 🤢🤢<sep>please tell me that this is made up story!<sep>Karley Sciortino; you are simply marvelous!

Is this the human way of marking property? :)<sep>Dumb<sep>Looool the ending of the video!😅<sep>🎩<br>😀<br>👕 HAVE A NICE DAY ALL !<br>👖<br>👞<sep>The Title of this video !! 😅<sep>Maybe he purchased them on eBay.<sep>interesting<sep>It was mine tho...GIVE IT BACK BIATCH<sep>I don’t get it<sep>Wow that story!!<sep>Fast forward a year???

UfjDM91rBm8,President Biden's Plan to Lower Inflation,"President Joe Biden has a plan to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages.  #Economy #Inflation Follow Joe!Joe’s Twitter: https://twitter.com/joebidenJoe’s Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joebidenJoe’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joebiden#JoeBiden #Economy #Inflation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfjDM91rBm8,"Im 1000% convinced the 2020 election WAS stolen!!<sep>you robbing me Brandon<sep>Question, why didn&#39;t I get anything back on my federal tax return? And you send money to Ukraine? How does that make any sense?<sep>It&#39;s been 4 years and inflation is still out of control<sep>One year later, has inflation which you raised got low? Nope, and the people who believe him are to blame. <br><br>Worst president in history, and you Biden supporters made all happen. Biden supporters are to blame for all that&#39;s wrong in the world today.<sep>Trump 2024<sep>Lets go Brandon<sep>Remember boys and girls, if you don&#39;t vote for joe biden, you ain&#39;t black.<sep>Yeah stop accounting for rent and groceries into the inflation equation. That&#39;s how you fixed inflation. So realistically you fixed it on paper, but didn&#39;t fix it.<sep>Everything he says he’s done, Trump did before Biden came to the whitehouse<sep>How do you cut the cost of childcare? Exactly Joe? How do you do that?<sep>Our costs have definitely gone down.  Inflation started in November 2 years ago.  And nothing has gone down or gone back nor will it ever except fuel, but it’s still incredibly too expensive. The economy came back so quickly because you shut the whole world down. If you forgot about your dictator ship in terms of closing, everything down and dictating that people get vaccinations and wear masks and if you don’t call that a dictator ship, I don’t know what you call it.<sep>When you was running for president, you would have a rally of like twenty people, donald trump would have rallies with tens of thousands of people you stole the election<sep>bro u started it😂<sep>Rofl &quot;lower your costs not your wages&quot;. Wow, Joe always has to prove that people can be dumber than I thought. I guess this will be like gas... it will double and then drop 3 cents and Joe will take credit for 3 cents cheaper but ignore that it is still 99% more.<sep>Nothing has changed. Inflation is ridiculous, the poor are getting poorer, and the rich wealthy are getting even more wealthier. Biden stop lying to the people.<sep>🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤣🤣🤣🍑🍑🍑🍑🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🍑🍑🍑🍑🤣<sep>Just stopped by to see what the comments are like and I must say I’m very pleased<sep>Step 1: print money.

Ai<sep>Liar<sep>Bro you&#39;re literally controlled by big pharma what are you talking<sep>&quot;we beat them cos we ARE them!&quot;<sep>FJB<sep>You didnt beat anything<sep>What pile of 💩<sep>no you didn&#39;t<sep>If you do it right,  you need almost no pharmaceutical drugs<sep>This not for America  this is for China, you may believe its for the American people, but as soon as you remove a patent from a company then Chinese companies will take over, Biden has sent your jobs and companies to China since 1981, when he gave most Favorable trade status to China sending thousands of thousands of American companies to China.<sep>Corporation and conglomerates control our politicians and gov&#39;t but it isn&#39;t interesting or mysterious enough. Our political partied might as well be companies because they only care about profits and control who can be president thats why nothing has changed<sep>Lies..... Lies and death<sep><b>Brought to you by </b><b><del>Umbrella Corporation</del></b><b> Pfizer</b><sep>“This ad brought to you by your loving, caring, supportive pharm companies!” <br><br>“Have you heard of the new shot?

Then again i never expected much from him anyways and i was right too, but atleast he got this win.<sep>&quot;This message was brought to you by Pfizer&quot;<sep>Is this for real!? Big Pharma loves this president and administration. Record profits and no accountability.<sep>Hold on, aren&#39;t doctors over prescribing drugs such as OxyContin? So if you lower prices of drugs, you are just fuelling addicts and incentivising Doctors to sell even MORE drugs to fuel the greedy profits of Big Pharma. I understand the intention, but this isn&#39;t the way. It should be illegal to advertise drugs.<sep>Americans are heading for the greatest awakening in American history. <br>As Carlin said &quot;Its a big club and we&#39;re not in it!&quot;<sep>Big pharma still won still selling drugs to the people who get diseases and long term illnesses from taking every pill that they are given by the medical industry they are still creating more infected people and still pushing pills and prescription grade drugs, just on a cheaper and more affordable rate, people we need to wake up.<sep>except for the forced vaccine, right?<sep>Peak irony... this delusional dude full-fledged supported big pharma...<sep>this is literally hilarious, politicians just say the total opposite of the truth and the amount of morons that believe them reduces ever year... wake up people, these are authoritarians and fascists and theyre literally stealing trillions of your money to enrich politically connected huge corporations, its time to shut this old and crazy peoples home down.<sep>Liar<sep>Someone should’ve yelled more lies<sep>I sincerely hope this works. It would be the best thing a president can do for senior citizens.<sep>This administration is Big Pharma’s best customer<sep>When you say you beat big Pharma when you&#39;ve been in on their scheme from the beginning and just use this as a political tool<sep>Pfizer made Billions you creepy coward!!!!!<sep>thats why we love biden<sep>They really lost big when those mandated jabs were shoved down the populations throats…..

You handed them billions and billions by buying and forcing everyone to get vaccinated and not just once.. They made more from the federal government than they would have made in a typical two year period.<sep>Yeah because having big government in private sector businesses always saves the public money🤣🤣🤣<sep>President Trump already did this.  biden lying again .<sep>Where is Hunters laptop, where is Ashley&#39;s diary.<sep>Big Pharma has blocked Joe’s brain medication for years<sep>Vote 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙<sep>Senile Joe....you&#39;re mentally and morally bankrupt.<sep>What a creep<sep>No you didn’t, you just came to a very small agreement.  On a very small issue in the grand scheme of things.<sep>Trump 2024!!!🇺🇸<sep>You didn&#39;t beat them you work with them hand in hand, oh the illusion of freedom and all the lies they spread<sep>That doesn&#39;t effect prices till 2027 though...and only on what, 30 different meds? Not all of them, so a select few reap that benefit while they get to pretend they did something and if anyone tried to stop the bill because it was a waste of time and paper, they will say that they tried to prevent you from saving money at the pharmacy counter. And when it comes time to see those effects, you&#39;ll forget completely about the bill and you&#39;ll all carry on as if nothing happened.<sep>I wish the people that voted an support Biden weren&#39;t missing brain cells 🥲<sep>The Resident of The United States of America is useless. Someone please take them back to the old folks home. 😂😅<sep>😒<sep>Donald Trumps bill to lower drug prices was far better and was blocked by democrats.<br>The Democrats are a fraud, doing the bare minimum to gain votes.<br>They are in bed with Big Pharma.<br>The lower prices most likely won’t even make up for the price increase from inflation.<sep>Yea joes not in bed with big pharma at all.<sep>Fraud elections have consequences!<sep>What is this guy talking about he’s in big Pharma‘s pocket<sep>He is never worked a job never done anything not one thing in the private sector anybody who even listens to this bag of Flesh and actually believes anything he says needs to check themselves big time<sep>As usual Lying to the public<sep>Government is the reason the prices are high in the first place<sep>Sold billions of doses of a product, to nearly every government in the world.

SsVXDDQaQhM,"President Biden Announces 431,000 New Jobs","President Biden speaks to the American people on the March jobs report. Unemployment is now down to 3.6%, and, in March, our economy created 431,000 jobs.  This is a historic recovery—Americans are back at work.   #JoeBiden #Economy #Jobs",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsVXDDQaQhM,"&quot;I&#39;ve thrown out these numbers, therefore, they are true.&quot;<sep>Let me guess for the immigrants cause he sure ain&#39;t doing nothing g for the Americans<sep>Work three job to support your self<sep>FJB<sep>Congrats to all of the middle outcome and the bottom up middle to low income people of our labor force from low income wages to the 2% of high ballers who help to keep the economy active! That said, we as the viewers of all political activity have this one question: If we were to put all 46 Presidents in the room with Biden, the current elected President, how many would be white? 45, and how many black, (1)! Therefore, the African cluster of voters in this native disaster is one and done! Please Proceed President Biden! No pressure, not from us! We voted in your favor! That makes us 1 and done, and two for the road!

However, to be fair, when Biden was started the world was going through a rather nasty pandemic, so a boon in jobs and employment is a given as things return to normal and places that were closed reopen and start hiring again. As to whether or not Biden has contributed to that boon, that&#39;s a separate issue, but it feels like it&#39;s being fused with this natural ebb and flow following everything shutting down and reopening.<sep>Biden didn&#39;t create diddly-sqwat - these are people going back to work after Joe and his cronies destroyed the economy... Pathetic!<sep>How is thejob prospects looking now? How&#39;s inflation doing? How&#39;s the gas prices looking?<sep>Bom  dia santo Biden que Deus abençoe ilumine os caminhos teus sempre te amo homem de atitude te amo te amo ❤❤❤❤❤ Biden tô pronta pra ir viajar vou pegar o ônibus 7e  15 da manhã depois pegar metŕo depois outro ônibus dai nós chegamos só falta tu pra minha felicidade ser completa ão meio dia uma hora eu entro em contato com tigo ❤❤❤❤❤te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>What a lier<sep>General Zaluzhny has clearly identified what Ukraine needs for the counteroffensive: 300 tanks, 600-700 ifvs, 500 Howitzers.

Always talking about how he is better than Trump, but with a wide open Border that has Drugs, Cartel, gang members and human trafficking coming in ,I ask my self who in their right mind voted for this guy  he is turning the United States into  a real mess. We have plenty of oil in the U.S but our fearless leader doesn&#39;t want to drill and pump, and finishing the pipeline he shut down. What a bozo.<sep>Things are looking up under Joe.

7-AAvESiRHU,We stand with Israel. #shorts,There’s no justification for terrorism.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AAvESiRHU,"Youtube, why are you paranoid of my comments, don&#39;t block. Covid bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2020 was intentionally masterminded in the shadows by Federation of American-Citizens Scientists (White Jewish Leadership, Republicans, Independents) and their Associates Worldwide. Wuhan bio-Lab leakage was not the origin of Covid. Trump and his GOP Allies lied on China as the source of Covid virus, China is a Victim like all other Countries Worldwide which have been affected with Covid pandemic. According to Perter Navarro&#39;s comments in KABC News two weeks after Wuhan Covid outbreak in 2020, he said &quot;we had Coronavirus briefing at the White House in November 2019, we were scared to go to sleep at night after the briefing&quot;. That means Peter Navarro, Trump and others who attended Covid Briefing at the White House in November 2019; before Wuhan Covid outbreak in 2020, they should have knowledge in Covid bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2020 and true source of Covid virus but they covered up. The same bioterrorist-Criminals; Federation of American Scientists masterminded in the shadows Global Mexico H1N1 bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2009, they used Homeland Security Clearances in travelling to Cancun Mexico; that way the Border Authorities couldn&#39;t inspect their carry-on bags or luggages.

US dollar is loosing its trust as reserve currency...Biden’s action of banning Russia from trading in the world’s Reserve Currency (ie the US dollar) has sent shockwaves throughout the world, and significantly eroded trust in the dollar, because other countries now know this could happen to them also. If the US fails to retain reserve currency status, the USA is finished because that status is the only thing preventing the US from being crushed under the weight of their enormous debt. The destruction of the dollar is intentional. Obviously so. Putin knows that too. We are watching the dividing of the nations into something like that of 1984 right before our eyes.<sep>use plane defenses and &quot;THE MEDS&quot; only if you have to against the russian planes and missiles, even if someone says they&#39;ll attack if you do, because it&#39;s your right to protect yourself! this would keep the people save as well but don&#39;t attack the rockets before they lansh the damage, for the rockets can be for  large area and destroy the missiles after it lansh on the air and before they fall down, let the russian run out for gasoline, now putin trying to buy oil from india let india understand the economic consequences from that and let them know the only reason is protecting the people in ukraine or other countrys trying to sell petrol to russia   the russian army will not have enough petrol to keep going in this war and they will have to lose to improve they country economy but that will take long time and sir I know that the russian economy ordey damage but we should keep putting economy pressure we can&#39;t trust them if you can manage to stop all the sells and the buying and I mean anything and everything with what it takes important form the congress too the make the russian economy week and it wouldn&#39;t stop the war but will give the ukraine advantage in this war because they need petrol for the armor and tanks.<sep>Let’s Go Brandon 💥💥💥<sep>Free palestine<sep>How about paying  our educators a decent income before they all leave the field because of burnout.<sep>Biden you are Canceled<sep>Joe, why can you bomb other nations, but Russia cannot?<sep>Joe Biden used YOUR TAX DOLLARS to send automatic weapons to Ukranian CIVILIANS, then complained when the Russians targeted  civilians as war targets.  If you hand out weapons of war to Civilians, you turn them into War Targets.

HE&#39;S A LIAR.<sep>Biden purposely wants to destroy america<sep>Hahahahaha!!! American<br>Democrats are condoning European billionaires to sponsor the Kremlin&#39;s invasion<br>of Ukraine, even though the Biden administration needs to confiscate all the<br>wealth of all European billionaires and corporations that do business in Russia<br>or buy something in Russia. (Subsidiaries and so on.) But American Democrats<br>lack the strength and integrity to do so. Americans, Vote Republican!<br>Republicans can do it all. Donald Trump should be elected American President in<br>2024 again! Moreover, American firms could buy Norwegian oil to sell it to<br>Europeans at a higher price. (The rich EU has the money to pay more for<br>Norwegian oil, especially if US firms buy cheaper Norwegian oil.) Powerful and<br>influential US Republicans can push all of this in Europe! Moreover, the<br>American Republicans are able to exclude Russia from the WTO and open the EU<br>market closed by protectionism. American Democrats have forgotten that the EU<br>has strong protectionism and a closed market contrary to the liberalism of the<br>Democratic Party. Therefore, the Democrats helplessly condone European<br>protectionism, even contrary to the ideology of their Party, showing the<br>political and economic weakness of not only the Democrats, but also the United<br>States! Do you want it, American voters? The leading EU states have a lot of<br>wealth to pay for American goods because they have robbed many states and<br>tribes during their history. Racism has been the basis of their centuries of<br>predatory policies, so it would only be fair for the US to punish Europeans for<br>racism!<br>Americans, come to work in Russian Kaliningrad! There is an easy non-corrupt<br>registration of labor migrants in the migration service. There is no corruption<br>in Kaliningrad, so there are no high-profile corruption arrests and<br>confiscations of the property of embezzlers and corrupt officials. (And there<br>are no international corruption scandals there either.) The crystal-clear,<br>hardworking and competent Investigative Committee of the Kaliningrad Region<br>makes sure that there is no corruption there! Moreover, the West&#39;s calculations<br>to impeach Putin and Russia&#39;s federal ruling oligarchic clans have failed. The<br>Biden administration and other ruling American Democrats hoped for the wrath of<br>the divided Russian Nation, but without a modern-day Vladimir Lenin, the communists<br>are not organizing a popular uprising, unlike October 1917. Non-communist<br>political leaders and organizations are unable to organize the Russian Nation<br>against the Kremlin oligarchs. Participation in the struggle of capitalists<br>against capitalists is not interesting for Russians, because they see no reason<br>to change one brand of Putinism for another. The American Democrats have again<br>shown weakness in the matter of impeaching Putin and the Kremlin oligarchy,<br>anti-Russian sanctions will not help in this. Americans, Vote Republican! Joe<br>Biden could have ordered Vladimir Zelensky to turn off the taps on the Russian<br>gas pipeline through Ukraine to stop funding the Kremlin&#39;s billionaires, but he<br>doesn&#39;t. But Donald Trump will not be afraid to order this! All American<br>Democrats can do is force ordinary Russians to endure retaliation against the<br>policies of their President Putin. Democrats are afraid of harming Putin and<br>his comrades! This is their main difference from the valiant Republicans.<br>Donald Trump was a real world Sheriff, before whom even the most powerful<br>foreign states trembled!<br>American Democrats are afraid of Chechens, Dagestanis, Ossetians, Bengalis,<br>Onkilons, Bai, Malagasy and Talysh. Therefore, they and their media, the Biden<br>administration and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky do not express their<br>opinions about Ramzan Kadyrov, his family, security guards and pro-Putin<br>associates fighting in Ukraine. However, Ramzan Kadyrov is not afraid to say<br>what he thinks about the Biden administration and other American Democrats,<br>their media and Vladimir Zelensky. Americans, Vote Republican! Ukraine is still<br>not part of Russia, so I want the Democrats to lose in the American elections.<br>If the US Democrats continue to win elections and beyond - then is it time for<br>the state of Texas to declare independence and become a separate foreign<br>independent state?
