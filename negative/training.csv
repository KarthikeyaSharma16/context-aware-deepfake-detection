If you aren&#39;t that smart to realize sarcasm, I can assure you this is that. Now the real thanks goes to president Trump for beating Isis and Sulemani, that was a real fight against terrorism. Trump has also put Iran to it&#39;s place - what Obama/Biden couldn&#39;t do. Trump is the one who deserves Nobel Peace prize rather than Obama and Presidential medal of Freedom with distinction rather than Biden.

I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&#39;s great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing.

I dont agree with you I think that children do not need things to feel secure and protected. Children can also feel safe in mamas arms<sep>Which explains why they can&#39;t choose their gender either.<sep>What an amazing mom .<br>Any one can give birth ..<br>Only few can be mother&#39;s<sep>He could be teething. He cries like he doesnt feel well.<sep>Thank you for these videos . I wish You were on tou tube when I was raising my kids .<sep>So beautiful to see the patience and love…something most children don’t get from the start.  <br><br>Another parent may have gotten frustrated and said something like, “what do you want??!” in an angry tone and children are forever scarred by these moments we think they won’t remember because they’re just children.  <br><br>They do remember, it’s in the cells. 😢<sep>This is a ruby frank in the making, she forces them to apologize, she forces them to eat food they dont want to the point they are crying and in distress, she uses punishments to “correct” bad behavior. She uses her kids souly to make money and try to spread weird parenting tips to other narcissist. She doesnt offer any tips on gentle parenting but claims to be a gentle parent. Shes the kind of mom who uses intimidation to get behavior she deems appropriate from her kids. Her kids clearly are being filmed without consent when they are upset with the excuse shes using it as a reason to teach while offering 0 advice for gentle parenting, just demands and high expectations from her kids. They never get to freely think or learn things on their own, she will tell them exactly what to do, what to say and even how to feel.<br><br>Do not support moms like this, shes using her kids to make content to make money she spends on herself. Shes a disgusting human being, ruby frank jr and youtube needs to remove her comments and page to save these kids. @youtube<sep>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>👶😘😘🇹🇷🙋<sep>❤❤❤😊😊😊<sep>It&#39;s a great life lesson to encourage a little one to self comfort.  We all have moments where we feel out of sorts &amp; seek ways to be reassured &amp; feel better.<sep>He’s so cute<sep>Stop sharenting<sep>Stop using this child for social media likes. He&#39;s always crying in your contrived scenarios just so you can show what a &quot;great mother&quot; you are. Stop it.<sep>Something I&#39;ve learned since becoming a mom is just allowing my son to feel his feelings and to be patient with him. Sometimes he just wants comfort and in the beginning it was so hard because I just wanted to get things done and have a clean home. But now that he&#39;s one and he&#39;s able to understand that I&#39;m not leaving him forever when I walk out of a room, he has settled down. We do the housework together and he seems to enjoy being included, and I get things done. It takes a little longer but he enjoys the quality time. But he has his days where he has big emotions and just needs me, and that&#39;s okay. I stop what I&#39;m doing and put him first. The half done dishes can wait.<sep>So sweet<sep>A Minky blanket makes me feel better too!<sep>❤❤❤<sep>If blanket is on floor why doesn&#39;t she put him down and allow him to  and bring it to her. It&#39;s will give him a sense of accomplishment.<sep>Sweet mom kids sweet. ❤<sep>God bless our Mothers❤❤<sep>how to you say  the palestain baby<sep>Where you find those massive stock of energy? Amazing<sep>Mad respect you’re doing a phenomenal job!!<sep>Thank you for the reminder to be loving with young children and not to give into our frustration. God bless!<sep>how about a  bed? or is the floor his happy place. seems he&#39;s begging for a nap.<sep>One time my little sister was sad. She was a little older than this baby, and I was about 14. I was holding her and asked her &quot;what&#39;s the matter?&quot; She said &quot;I want you.&quot; So i said &quot;You can have me.&quot; It was so cute, she grabbed my arm, said &quot;have&quot;, and then she was happy! I guess she just needed a little love!❤<sep>So beautiful. Xxxx❤❤❤❤❤<sep>You are such a great mom.God didn&#39;t make a mistake when he made you a mother. You are really a blessing to your kids.May God continuesly bless you.<sep>Wish I had known how to do this when my kids were small. You seem wise.<sep>I bet there are moments when all kids are working on her last nerve. That’s how it is with kids &amp; the older they get the more difficult it gets. Mainly because a blankly doesn’t soothe a 16 year old!!<sep>this is how caring of a mom i wanna be❤️<sep>I don&#39;t really have any comfort object to offer 🤔 she still breastfeeds though, so I guess that&#39;s what she associate with soothing and comfort, but that will have to go soon...<sep>Fantastic Mother<sep>Every video from you that has been in my reccomended so far is of your son screaming or fussing. Maybe include some moments where he is happy as well? <br><br>At this point I&#39;m starting to think his atmosphere is causing his extreme discontent, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the opposite of what you&#39;re trying to get across.<sep>It makes me so happy to see someone understanding and honoring the big feelings in their small children instead of shaming them and telling them they have nothing to cry about! Thank you for your healthy example!<sep>Such a patient mum❤<sep>This will help other mom &amp; d a d❤❤❤❤<sep>I don&#39;t have children, but the way you care for your children.<br>I love ❤your ways.<br>Absolutely beautiful 🥰they will<br>Grow up to be the most kindest, sweetest, human beings.<br>You ought to be proud of your beautiful values. <br>I love ❤️ learning from you.<br>Keep up the amazing work that you do.  Kia Kaha Gorgeous mum ❤️❤️🙏👍🤓<sep>little one is just tired and overstimulated. hug will do the trick<sep>I agree that you&#39;re a loving and patient mum, to a point. However, it is never a good idea to have children, or indeed anyone, place their trust for confort and security in a material object. It&#39;s an erronrous teaching, and one that will ultimately lead them into error and distress.<br>For anyone who would criticise what I am saying: just as this woman has the freedom to offer advice on child rearing, because effectively that&#39;s what she&#39;s doing, so too, have I the right to disagree with her!<sep>Ich liebe diese Frau.😊<sep>The most beautiful upbringing by  an amazing mother to her baby boy is adorable and heart winning touch to life. She really knows what motherhood is !<sep>🤮🤮<sep>Tender Love and Care❤❤❤❤❤<sep>You are such a lovely mother.

I love his little blanket hug ❤<sep>If they cry but they do not want anything, 😢, means they&#39;re tired and want to have a bottle of milk and sleep, believe me they will be fresh and and bubbly when they wake up...<sep>I really love your cooperation with them you are the best ever really❤❤❤❤<sep>I love this!

What is a Democrats rebuttal to the following:<br><br>&quot;Donald J. Trump is the first President in 39 years (since Jimmy Carter) not to launch a pre-emptive war, conflict or military strike on a foreign nation (whereas Obama launched military strikes on PAKISTAN, LIBYA, SYRIA, YEMEN and SOMALIA for starters) and Trump has brought more than 4000 US troops home, calmed relations with North Korea and Russia, brokered 2 Middle East peace deals and an important economic deal between Kosovo and Serbia. <br><br>Given the fact that Trump pushed through a bi-patisan prison reform bill, The First Step Act which gives nonviolent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens and which has overturn many aspects of the racist Bill Clinton/Joe Biden crime bill of 1994. Trump has already commuted the unfair sentences of hundreds of people, 91% of them being black. Why didn&#39;t Obama do this? Trump has now signed into law permanent, record breaking funding for Historically Black Colleges. Why didn&#39;t Obama do this? Trump created Opportunity zones to bring $9bn of jobs and investments to low-income neighborhoods and just recently presented the President&#39;s &quot;Platinum Plan&quot; to focus on creating 500,000 black businesses among other things. Why didn&#39;t Obama do this? Back in June, Trump signed an Executive Order to create a national database of police misconduct, among other actions, enabling the Justice System to truly start holding rogue or racist cops accountable. Why didn&#39;t Obama or Biden do this after holding power for 8 years? <br><br>All Obama did was wage wars for the corrupt military industrial complex and increase food stamps for blacks. One step forward 8 steps back. So yes, vote, for TRUMP 2020” Simon Webster<sep>Description of the video : You know who Joe Biden is.

People like me, north of I-70, with Electric Heat are paying 10.6 cents / KWhr UNder BIDEN. I have to shop for electricity generation rate for my Electric Thermal Storage and Electric Baseboard Heat. Cheapest I can find right now is 7.1 cents. I paid 4.5 cents during Trump. We had the solar scam salesman to our house. He can’t scam enough solar panels and batteries into our house to provide 50% of our “already green” Electric Thermal Storage Heaters and it would have been a $54,000 loan.<sep>fucking populism. Why wasn’t all this done during his presidency?<sep>Great Americans. Why do you support this garbage? I just don&#39;t understand.<sep>TULSY GABBARD FOR VICE PRESIDENT TRUMP!!<sep>No one speaks of increasing social security. people who rely on social security are not allowed to save more then 2000 at one time. If I have 2100 in my bank account, my social security gets taken away. Further. Why can&#39;t social security be paid out to match a decent wage?  I only get 1060 per month. Take in consideration the cost of housing, food, utilities and we are broke. I have not driven in over 20 years because I can not afford it. I am down to just the basics of living as it is. I rent a basement room from a relative who was kind enough to allow it. but a basement is not ideal especially when confined to a wheelchair. I can crawl but not well. I get up and down the stairs but it sure is not easy. but this is much better then being homeless witch is where i&#39;d be if not for family. This country is getting great for the rich but the poor keeps getting worse. Look at medic aid. they no longer pay for anything around my town. it is impossible to find a doctor who takes it. Something has to be done soon. I know nothing will be done for the poor people in this country. The rich don&#39;t care about us.<sep>Man!

Read that again: Less than one 20th of 1 percent. Of that: Human activity in its entirety (including cow farts) contributes just 3% of Co2 plant food. The oceans contribute the other 97%. Let&#39;s calculate that: 3% of 0.04% means humans contribute 0.0012% of Co2 plant food. USA contributes about 12% of that (0.000144%, effective ZERO) So that means the renewables hoax rests on enough people believing that cutting that 0.000144% plant food to 0.000% is going to change the weather of the planet and maintain present booming levels of crop yields. It is a vast CON. Global warming is rubbish. We are actually in a global cooling period that has been going on for thousands of years. Nuclear power is the long term solution to fossil fuel. Coal and gas are solid short to medium-term solutions. Trump knows what he is talking about. USA under Biden is destroying itself to boost China&#39;s economy. Simple. &quot;We&#39;ve got to finish the job, man!&quot; says Biden. Finish the job of destroying the country.<sep>I am staggered by Donald Trump&#39;s tenacity and ability to withstand the pressures on him on the legal front.

Thank you for your years of service to the great nation of the United States. Thank you for having a youtube channel. God bless you Sir, and stay safe.<sep>Let&#39;s work together. I deeply love this country and firmly believe that we can return to the truth and fulfill our historical mission. At this moment, we are in the midst of a domestic struggle. This struggle is not merely a racial conflict, nor is it solely a disagreement between Democrats and Republicans. It is about the confrontation between all those who love America, support its values, and those who oppose the core ideals of America, as well as the long-established institutional groups and every citizen&#39;s rights. Now, we need a commander-in-chief who can lead us to victory in this struggle, and he is the man standing before you—Trump.<br><br>If you want border security, vote for Trump; if you want to restore national law and order, support Trump; if you want to challenge and defeat the so-called deep state, choose Trump; if you want to fight inflation, cast your vote for him; if you want to revitalize national pride, trust Trump; if you want to reshape our national identity, steadfastly support Trump; if you want to make America great again, the answer is still to vote for Trump. This is how we will win the November election by an overwhelming majority, just like President Reagan did in 1980. Donald Trump will bring such a victory in November this year, uniting the entire country once again. Everyone, please fulfill your civic duty, come out to vote in the primary on Tuesday night, and then defeat Biden in the November election. The most glorious days of our nation are still ahead of us.

He wants to be the emperor and wants his daughter to inherit. He has been in president for four years and has treated the White House as his company. During the Covid-19, he made people drink toilet liquid, but his son-in-law made a fortune! He is very selfish and wishes that the entire White House leadership team was from his family. This is why he will fire even those who work for him through life and death and throw them into prison! How many marches did he have during his four years in office? The American people should not forget that he is a big liar! If Americans are fooled by him again, the United States will become Russia, North Korea and China!<sep>My great Mirror,  At this age,  you are still working really hard! Full of energy.

0CpznVak0OU,Elon Musk’s thoughts about the war… Source: @lexfridman #podcast #elonmusk #shorts #short #war,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CpznVak0OU,"True!<sep>they do not care ... they just want to rob the land using USA tax money<sep>Israel has stolen the land of Palestinians killed their children, women and men you expect them not to resist and have hatred in their hearts towards Israelis you have got to be kidding me.<sep>Smart guy<sep>When someone k*lls you, because you k*lled their children, how they are named h*m*s? And you’re still i*r*el?<sep>Clean the entire shit<sep>You all think original hamas creators and members came from the sky?<sep>ههههه انهم يصنعون  حماس حتى خارج غزة هل تعتقد ان غزة فقط من تتالم 😅😅😅😅😅😅<sep>He is a genius explained it very well<sep>And then he got blackmailed bew zionists elite gays and was forced to stand and 💯 fully support the idf like a stupid gay child<sep>Exactly 💯<sep>Why is this case with Muslim community only.<sep>Thug life <br>The hate u give little infants fucks everybody<sep>It&#39;s a weird comparison to make but, Elon is like reverse Tony Stark<sep>An intelligent Christian does not want Christians to participate in this issue, he does not say that non-Christians, and even Christians, in Central and South America, Africa and Asia, either suffered from colonization or became victims of genocide against them by the United States and his European allies, these nations will never forgive Western Christians who supported the murderers of children + in Gaza... and it will come back to haunt them very hard, and possibly fatally... He just cares about his people. And as a person who really thinks deeply, he is sad about the future. Maybe he thinks AI will save the West? No! Of course not! He even knows this. Maybe the time of the coming of Jesus (alaihissalaam) has come?<sep>True statement<sep>But thats the beauty of islam.. they r the only 1s who want to die as martyrs so that they can b in the heavens with the prophets.. listen to an isrealu and a palestinian the way they speak is good and evil bcos isreal lives for wordly things n muslims live 4the eternal life... tgis has bern going on for 75yrs n theyv not retaliated in the sane way... but inevitably the younger generation has different thinking bcos of western propoganda, corruption, lies, hypocracy n its crimes<sep>Oh shut up<sep>Logical point of view/observation.<sep>Never ending story. Only God can solve this problem.<sep>his tone is saying that free Palestine and open your eye O American and other powerful human<sep>This is a Western premise taken out of a Clint Eastwood movie. 1929 no Israel no occupation Jews are sloughed by Arabs in Hebron because the Mufti spread lies that Jews are going to desecrate Al Aqsa. 1964 Arafat established the PLO - no occupation as this is before the 6 day war. Arabs have not accepted the existence of Jews in Israel and the Middle East. Recent 2023 survey 75% of Arabs in the Middle East hold antisemitic views. At the hight of the peace process 1995 Arab territories blow up buses in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv hundreds killed. This is not a spaghetti western it is reality in which if Palestinians do not forgo their blind hatred no peace can be achieved. So dear Musk you haven’t studied this in depth enough. Disappointing!!!<sep>Thjs is why he is Elon musk 🎉 they don&#39;t understand<sep>Before he intimidated....<sep>Wow. There&#39;s some very stupid, idealistic and small minded comments here.<sep>Finally he speak and has guts. <br>Saudi’s learn something from Ellon Musk.<br><br>Shame on you !! Coward middle east countries<sep>Hate cannot take out Hate.<sep>Zioni-sm is an infectious hate spreading disease. It is growing the gap between Judaism and other religions. Isolationist nature of Zi-oni-sm is detrimental to human harmony and an incitation to violence. Hamas is a form of resistance to Zio-nist colonial occupation of Palestine.<sep>They all agree that children are being slaughtered by Israelis. They are just hypocrites<sep>Very true<sep>I wonder how much Israel/US is paying this guy.<sep>The sadistic brutality is probably trauma causing<sep>76 years of brutality, illegal occupation, apartheid and now genocide... what should oppressed people  do.<sep>Got that Right!!! In 1947 England STRIPPED Natives  who were &quot;Palestinians Passport HOLDERS&quot; their Citizenship RIGHTS OFF OF THEM &quot;.<br> Only if they were anyother Religious Groups; Whom were Living in Harmony... Christians, Muslims, Hindus or Non Believers EXCEPT if you are of Jewish descendent You can Still go back???<sep>We need kind people, no matter who they are or where they come from.<sep>100% correct<sep>The question is for every H. member u&#39;ve killed how many children u killed? How many pregnant woman aborted? How many girls will never be the same again? How many men tortured , kidnapped burried alive ? How many families were erased from the records?<br>U&#39;ve committed so much atricities that hate will surround u forever<sep>That was before they bought him 😂😂 he is another puppet now<sep>I dont think so. Muslim person might be upset when their children got killed, but im sure they are happy bcs muslims believes that innocent child will go to heaven.<br><br>The reason they fight or join hamas IS NOT bcs they want to seek revenge. They are not liberals, come on!! They are muslims! 😂<br><br>They just fight for freedom, defending their land &amp; religion. They will b happy if they died in battlefield. How can you beat a person who happy to die in battlefield??<br><br>If youre a muslim, you will b understand this kind of faith. So... Revenge? Nah!<sep>This is the first time i have heard some reasonable word from him more than anti islam Or white hipocracy.<sep>Palestinian peoples or warriors, In this war, you creating thousands of orphans, what do you expect from them? Do they fight back but you can call them terrorists<sep>Come on Mr muscular more intelligent than that you know what needs to be done<sep>Well then you got to get them all<sep>Not measuring success correctly or put anther way the objective Isreal had from the start was flawed.<sep>And another thing hamas is a terrorist or freedom fighters?<sep>That is first and biggest question we ask at the first. Western countries created millions Hamas now.<br>As much as you push on that much you create. Taliban is an example.<sep>How many innocents you have saved by not killing the evil?<sep>Nice propaganda so that you can sell more cars<sep>💯 % correct<sep>So sorry to hear these things and taking wrong side from such a great man<sep>False problem. Leaving Hamas in power there means they create new members. They indoctrinate kids in schools to blame all the problems on Israel, while they dig up water pipes to turn into rockets, that a quarter of the time land in Gaza instead; For example the one that blew up the hospital that was initially blamed on Israel.<sep>This is man is telling the truth<sep>Violence begets violence. In trying to eradicate your foes you will get more hatred around the world.<sep>U r funny<sep>Get out<sep>100%!<sep>Israel wants to take the region, so it will push to create enemies who will eventually retaliate so it can justify conquest. For their policy it is a win win because they have the allies and the weapons to do it, they just need the allies to be on board. You can see it in their policies with the Palestinians, pushing every line to see how hard and far they can push with settlements and terrorising of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, building exclusive infrastructure, taking land, and controlling security. Classic assertion tactics. Balancing a line of making incremental territorial, infrastructural, and security gains. They know they can push pretty hard without any repercussions, then combine that with powerful lobby interests abroad, a well funded PR campaign of diluting the term antisemitism meanwhile holding the full force of the meaning of the term, and throwing the term at any critic, and controlling the media narrative and you&#39;ve got a triple lock protection system for an agenda of internationally accepted conquest.<sep>Exactly<sep>So the definition of hammas is Every human who can feel for another human is hammas<sep>Absolutely correct.  You cannot kill an ideology born of injustice, apartheid or outright murder.<br><br>Might never made right. Brutality never made docile recipients.<sep>Smart thinking<sep>Don&#39;t believe this sellout, he&#39;s also complicit in this genocidw<sep>1000% true<sep>When they are told, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they reply, “We are only peace-makers!”1<sep>In every war situation your country is involved mr musk<sep>Well said Elon.<sep>He can come to gaza become thier mair and lead them to mars, but he doesnt, elon is just talk. Where my cat girls elan?<sep>He’s rich for a reason.<sep>So ultimately Gandhi is the solution 😂<sep>Imagine killing parents in front of kids do you have any idea what kind of weapon you are creating that kid won’t have any other feeling in mind other than hatred and nothing to loss will make that kid a focused person and yes in political sense he have the right to take revenge for spoiling his life<sep>Then he took u trun from his views and started appeasing Zionist Israel regime<sep>actually thats wrong. the israeili AI called &quot;Wheres Daddy&quot; wich creates thousands of targets a week and bombs ≈ 20 civilians per a  succesfully bombed identified hamas target, whilst mostly choosing incorrect targets. thats based o what multiple verified israeili intelligence persons report. also, check out the flour massacre on gazan children. btw barely any people join hamas anymore, even not the people who got their families bombed, cuz of their faith tbh.<sep>What he said reminded me of this Quote <br>“Sometimes monsters are made, not born.”<sep>Just saybit as it is its wrong for anyone to kill innocent but IDF have killed millions more then hamas so who is the real terrorist Elon musk needs to be open and stop finding fake answers<sep>If you start a fight expect to get hit.<sep>Right<sep>The Muslims murdered 1400 Jews on a holy day. What is your solution, Elon?<sep>Look at germany, how many children died in ww2? And how many nazis are there compared to back then? The war is the first step, reformation of the education systems will come afterwards<sep>Lol this clown was visiting Israhell and smiling for the cameras etc etc never called out the gen0cide!<sep>Respect bro for telling the truth.<sep>Amazing logic, opened my brain ... ..<sep>Pure speculations, what do we do when there is bad grass in your plantations...words×words lead to blablabla<sep>He is right<sep>Exactly. Jews aren&#39;t as smart as people make them out to be. Sooner or later there will be a huge action against Israel. It is inevitable. Jews should be making friends, not enemies.<sep>You cannot kill an ideology<sep>😂 good luck to Israel they think they’re gonna live in peace in their so-called motherland.<sep>He meant that dont kill terrorist otherwise his children relative will become terrorist.. 🤣🤣<sep>eggggggzactly<sep>So why do u block pro Palestine on x😂😂😂😂<sep>Crazy how many people think the first killings happened on october 7th<sep>Better you keeps quite<sep>Who is he to give advice. If you stop one factory from joining the union, how many workers that want to join the union do you create.<sep>IDF or America or Europe etc never create any single Hamas members. These Hamas and Hezbollah and such terrorists have been creating themselves at their own nets, and on the lately events in Israel land, these terrorist hamas emerging to the surface. And we could see, this terrorists exist almost all over the world where oslom exits, and their amount million and million. So it is clear that hatred have been existing in the very hearts and minds of this satanic cult.<br>They are under a very deep hypnotic condition !<br>So please never blame the IDF nor Israel.<br>How if your beloved ones got killed on 7th October ?? Were you gonna dancing or laughing ?<br>Please Elon M don&#39;t be a hypocrite. It seems to me that your luck is fading away, because you blame who stood beside Israel.<sep>And they are going to be called terrorists where in fact they’ll be seeking revenge . Not a good future for Israelis or Palestinians.<sep>elon must 😂😂😂 he supported beast game he trying to promote evil illuminati<sep>.........and if you do nothing?<sep>But he is supporting the Zionesst how Hypocrite is that<sep>Palestinians have every right to every thing that has been stolen from them, together with reparations! But I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be satisfied with less - namely full rights of return, equality in ONE democratic and secular state - whatever that is called!!<sep>So what&#39;s his solution? hamas did kill someone else&#39;s children on October 7th but i guess Israel should just roll over and offer the other cheek.<sep>This guy is just printing money on innocent blood. He sold his everything infront of the xionists.",0

Everyone knows Trump would rock his world.<sep>yea and tomorrow you would be shitting out those dentures, FJB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<sep>Vote Trump in 2024<sep>Vote Trump in 2024<sep>This hair sniffer is a joke<sep>Good Luck Mr. Trump<sep>Goddamn black lives matter burned down my car, and thousands of others, and have the audacity to call it &quot;justice&quot;.<sep>This should be running on TV, as an ad for Trump. (That is, if the TV stations would ACTUALLY air it).<sep>First time ive ever heard Hillary say something truthful <br>&quot;Cannot be civil with anyone who stabds against what you believe&quot;<br><br>I agree<sep>These idiots have no idea that they are poking a bear, and if that bear is forced to get up and defend itself, they are going to be torn to shreds.<sep>I hate the left.... took a great nation, and is just demolishing it....<sep>Just like their fellow Progressive, Adolph Hitler.<sep>If i had said anything about &quot; blowing &quot; anything up I&#39;d be in jail without bail, yet alone any government building.

Yeah, there&#39;s an old man wandering around the campus here and asking about a gym.  I think it might be JoeTato.  Can you come get him?  He&#39;s fallen 3 times.&quot;<sep>Truth<sep>For once I agree with Hilary.  We cannot be civil with people who want to destroy what we believe in.<sep>Biden wouldn’t even be able to beat up someone tied to a chair.

It&#39;s not even a conversation at this point.<sep>“Violence is never justified, but” - Democrats<sep>Lmfao what’s even funnier is that Joe in high school looks as though he couldn’t ever beat up anyone<sep>Why didnt you &quot;LOCK HER UP&quot;, Donny? You said you would!<sep>Gnatzees.<sep>Joe sniffs little girls.<sep>CHOOCHOOOOOOOO TRUMPTRAIINNNNNN<sep>Trump was good for the whole world!!<sep>Gotta love these lefties with their empty threats.

They will sell out to the highest bidder.<sep>Only thing I noticed in this statement Biden made was that he still had life in his eyes.<br>Take a look at this Biden and now he&#39;s fucking gone. It&#39;s just like any other old person with dementia they are just a gomer now. <br>I never supported Biden to begin with but at least when he started his campaign he had a spark of himself left.<sep>IM🍑PEACH JO HIDEN!!!! <br>F*ck YouTube&#39;s 🤐🤐🤐 al-gore-rythms!<sep>And then they will blame Trump for all the Mayhem they cause…I’m with Vivek on this over 50% of the Federal Government needs to be cut.

Oh absolutely, they are also the ones, the only ones that shot someone at the so-called insurrection, they killed an unarmed girl guilty of climbing in a window while they terrified people with slanderous rumors and rushed through voting under a false premise that was repeatedly reported and they will be held accountable for that.

Incentivize whistleblowers to report waste and fraud in federal and state governments with bonuses based on the reported savings and fraudulent activities.

Giving them zero incentives to reduce spending and every incentive to increase and this has been going on for years. <br>America is bankrupt and needs to be dealt with in those terms.<sep>You&#39;ll get my vote<sep>I pray for you.

This enemy is no longer the Western and Eastern governments and foreigners or foreign spies who cause The people of Iran have become poor and miserable. This legitimate enemy is ready to take revenge at any moment and is looking for the right opportunity. This situation did not exist in the historical and political past because the religious class or other social classes had not yet had the opportunity to rule, but Now there are only two social classes in Iran, the first one is considered illegitimate in the eyes of the second class, i.e. the people, because it has passed the test of running the country with corruption, theft, and the crimes it has committed. It happens that one side is the people of Iran and the other side is the government until it reaches a point where only the people rule over the people of Iran, which is called a parliamentary republic or democracy. The Islamic Republic, by its behavior, turns the society into two poles, positive and negative. and the direction of the negative pole of these two poles is the government itself. History has always proven that no force has been able to stop the public opinion of the people, because God is the legitimacy of the thoughts and collective wisdom of the people, what kind of government they want to be ruled over. That government is called democracy, in which the people become two parties, and the king and the sheikh are no longer at the head of the country&#39;s administration. So, the result is that the Islamic Republic has done a great favor to the people of Iran and the generations to come by its behavior, and it has caused an awakening and The people of Iran have become aware that they have an evil force and a negative pole in front of them and they are passing through it.<sep>Is there any other leader, even globally, who lays out their manifesto to their constituents so plainly?<sep>👍🏻🇺🇸🇬🇧<sep>The Deep State hates you because they had to sell their souls to get where they are, and you didn’t .

Jimmy fuccc that pe do file tom.  BLanka Shore got shot at last week as Tom Cruises cult and his boyfriend David Miscavige rob out country blind. He is just as bad as Donald TRump.  In Blanka Shores case the cult never left her alone after she visited celeb center in mid 2000&#39;s. to buy books.    For years they have destroyed her life and the public will in time learn the truth and how really dangerous, delusional and how much of a murdering thief Tom is. We all know dick cruise is obsessed with BLanka Shore and she can&#39;t stomach that criminal, domestic terrorist cunt. Tom Cunt stole BILLIONS from  our gov with fraud investigations via Scientology including David Spade and Brad Pitt.  When legal shiiiit hits the fan lets see what tOMS BOYFRIEND David Miscavige and Sci cult have to say  about stealing millions, if not billions from tax payers.

Me and my sister are like: &quot; Tom Cruise..Meehhh!&quot;<sep>sure, but what have you done with your own daughter, tom?<sep>..Отличного дня!!..😏🙋💖<sep>She was never in line of succession as she was not the offspring of the queen or of King charles she is also not a sister to the princes<sep>Last time you saw your daughter Tom? hmmm....<sep>Scientology is a Cult! Cruise supports Free Child Labor, Trafficking and Disconnection from their families!<sep>Whats with the distracting clips,? Like we dont know what &quot;staring&quot; and &quot;looking around&quot; looks like? Wtf?<sep>Sounds like Ethan Hunt on a mission 😂<sep>That is the mentality of our society today.  Heads down and no eye contact.<sep>I will do that the same if it&#39;s was me 🥰🤗😉❤<sep>I wish they could meet again… that’s freakin awesome and If I was him… I’d absolutely HAVE too..<sep>He belongs to a church which destroys families.

Great story for you and a great one for her with proof!<sep>KSW ❤<sep>She knew the assignment but she wanted proof that she saw what she saw.😂<sep>Sorry but im not buying it! Tom Cruise on a subway?! Naah, I think this is one of those typical BS made up stories that they have to come up with to tell on late night talk shows (as seen in Entourage episode). I know there are a lot of big stars that are down to earth like Keanu etc that rides the subway and buses on the regular ... but Tom Cruise...? I have a hard time seeing him ride the tube without there being a massive hysteria.<sep>Yeah like the science guys let him go unattended on the subway … he’s got 5 round him at all times get real 😂<sep>I am the girl<sep>Si stai zitto perché hai già detto un sacco di cazzate   va a pulire i cessi e china la schiena<sep>Das ist in Top Gear, tolle Sendung<sep>WOO❤❤❤<sep>J avais déjà entendu cette histoire.

We idolize people who lie for a living and ignore our God , Jesus Christ, and what he did to save us from our rebellion. <br>If anyone cares, we must believe 1 Corinthians 15 1-4 to be saved from hell.<sep>Very clever young girl.<sep>Why 14? Asked her? Just curious, great storytelling<sep>Yes<sep>Can’t imagine going to crowd hoping no one sees you 😢<sep>Only beauty could found Tom Cruise as he glowed with his beauty ❤😊🔥💯✨️😘😇🌟🫶🙌😉👏💖<sep>I wish that girl sees this short and realizes that was her.<sep>Creepy scientologist👹😵‍💫💩👹😵‍💫💩<sep>All them 14 year old kids being used as gives labour for Scientology Tom do you always remember them?<sep>He&#39;s such a POS.

1qska9APRyo,The oil industry has a choice.,Either begin to invest in America or pay higher taxes on your excessive profits.Follow Joe!Joe’s Twitter: https://twitter.com/joebidenJoe’s Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joebidenJoe’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joebiden#JoeBiden #shorts #shortsvideo #shortsvideoviral,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qska9APRyo,"YEAH AND HOW PROFIT DID YOU MAKE , DAMM HYPOCRITE !<sep>Let’s Go Brandon<sep>Time to put a price tag on carbon emissions Biden!!<sep>Wow, all these negative comments. I had no idea so many people love oil companies making excessive profits and contributing to high inflation. But meanwhile, negativity for Joe Biden should instead be had for not following through with pushing for windfall profits taxes when he had the chance during his first 2 years as President. But Dems&#39; bills that passed have mitigated inflation, oil prices are lower than last year, and many peoples&#39; wages are on the rise. And that admittedly slow progress is due to severely watered-down Left-leaning bills that were passed and signed into law. Just think how much better things can get if more Left-leaning and Progressive politicians were elected to fight for more common-sense laws to invest in us rather than giving rich people and corporations breaks, i.e. breaks from taxes and breaks from accountability for gouging us!! A lot of the negative comments for this video actually acknowledge that oil companiesmay have unnecessarily increased gas prices in response to mere rhetoric from Joe Biden, not to mention how they pay their executives without increasing all of their workers&#39; wages proportionally AND how they export large portions of their product instead of helping lowering prices for domestically-sourced oil... and they blame Joe instead of the oil companies for high gas prices!? It&#39;s unreal how people make the leaps in llogic about who is to blame!! So this year, we can reelect Trump and elect other Republicans and guarantee that the wealth inequalities and National Debt in this country grow at unprecedented rates, like it did during Truml&#39;s first term. Or we can make the clear beneficial choice, people: don&#39;t just vote Blue, vote Prpgressive so that &quot;moderate&quot; Dems like Joe get pressured to actually follow through on rhetoric like in this video! Problems don&#39;t get fixed at all or fast enough because we don&#39;t give Progressives enough power to enact the solutions to our problems that have already worked in many other countries. So we can continue to hold ourselves back with conservatives or we can choose tonfinally make real Progress!<sep>The Russian trolls are out in force today.  They must be scared.<sep>You should worry about the open border instead of what the USA Oil companies are doing. Try helping the oil companies get permits and pump oil like crazy. Instead of shutting down American oil and gas and coal to support the enemies brain dead Brandon<sep>Another company that sells gasoline is Costco<sep>And also pollutes the water for other people, not just America by around the world and affects people with disabilities<sep>But guess where oil is made originally it’s made in the country in Africa through children and it’s killing the animals<sep>You made it clear? When? VOTE FOR ANYONE EXCEPT BIDEN!<sep>And....Don&#39;t forget how You were First in your law class at Syracuse!! Complete FRAUD AND LIAR AND TRAITOR!!<sep>But YOU, your BROTHER, and HUNTER are doing just fine! And gas was $1.85 a gallon before the BRANDON Presidency!!<sep>Biden destroyed our oil pipeline to Canada cuz of the climate change thingy with fracking, which was one of the reason gas went up for us.. then he sanctions russia, don&#39;t blame the oil companies<sep>😂😂😂<sep>This guy is a scumbag<sep>Liar.<sep>Yes when Joe went in he cut production causing a rise in price so they either immediately  started buying back the stock or started when they knew Treasonous Joe was going into office<sep>Now gas prices are back down again. Thanks Joe! These oil companies sure did take their sweet ol time ramping up production until Joe forced them to. Go Biden!<sep>Trump on his website platform wants to give Billionaires Oil companies tax breaks and cuts !  Lol drill drill drill ! What a joke!! Trump on his platform wants to cut off the inflation bill package !  That would mean food and Gad prices would skyrocket! Medicine costs for the elderly would skyrocket as well! Vote blue across the board<sep>Your just mad you didnt get that money joe<sep>Stop their subsidies! Give that money to clean energy.<sep>Biden Biden 🤦🏻‍♂️<sep>Someone, please get him off the stage. Change his diaper and tuck him in.<sep>Tax big oil that’ll bring down the prices at the pump and the cost of groceries you go, Joe<sep>Thank you President Biden for working for the people! Ignore the bots and cut!<sep>Well said, truth !<sep>Isnt he making them richer with the 2 regional wars?<sep>I love pres..biden❤❤❤ I&#39;m folks<sep>Oh I wish our corrupt Tory government would have the guts to say and do this! But then they are shareholders themselves!<sep>This comment section is filled with chinese/Russian bots and crackheads.<sep>You made money from China<sep>If he was lying big oil reps would be on every Tv calling him out on it. Ppl with money don&#39;t car about nothing but making more of it at any cost.<sep>BIDEN 2024<sep>Vote Biden for democracy!!! Hey, could you have done better?? Then run for president!!<sep>Amen! President Joe biden 2024🙏😊❤️👋<sep>…but it’s okay for Pfizer to gouge.<sep>Shake your head Joe marbles R not in proper order 😂😂😂<sep>He&#39;s so awful. I love paying the CEOs . I wish they would take everything I own. How dare he not feed their greed??<sep>How much is Biden worth again?<sep>The Russian bots are out in force today! Biden&#39;s doing a great job. Cheers,<sep>Supply and demand sir.  You created less supply and drove up the price.  Thus speech is fake frustration.   You knew exactly what you were doing.  You want the oil companies to be the enemy of the people so you can replace with wind mills and solar panels from china.   No one is fooled here….sadly many people are going without other important items so they can purchase higher priced gas.  The oil companies are not the bad guys here as you are trying to paint them.<sep>Biden ur the one that cutting back oil and wanted electric. How is this guy become the president?<sep>That&#39;s nearly as much as biden 😊<sep>How can you tell other people to pay tax when his own son doesn&#39;t pay tax.😂<sep>What’s the point of mentioning this when they’ve bought you too Biden? 😮<sep>What is wrong with  you if companies make money. People have high paying jobs not like you getting money from China and Ukraine you and you family should be in jail.<sep>You people actually hear what this idiot is saying? Do not elect this tyrant!!! Trump 2024.<sep>The rest of the story. You caused it by putting road blocks for drilling and pipelines.<sep>That&#39;s nothing. He gave away 130 billion to Ukraine in 18 months.<br>I&#39;d rather see stock holders profit because that&#39;s why we buy stocks. And if we make enough money we pay Capital Gains Taxes.<br>Does Ukraine pay us taxes on the cash and hardware they receive?<sep>Then use the executive orders to do something.<sep>Wow trumpers are just dumb as stumps.  They hate biden so much, makes me like the guy, almost.<sep>You cheated to get where you are you cheated<sep>祝福拜登总统阁下和您的国民.平安健康快乐.謝謝.<sep>Grifting Old Party = GOP<sep>Drive electric. 😊<sep>He cries about taxes, but fails to mention that the tax laws these companies use are written by Senators like him, Harris, Clinton, Schumer, Warren, Durbin, etc.<sep>Biden is bombing Iran, Syria, and Yemem - Biden is starting WW3, but the liberals are so blinded by their hatred for Trump that they can&#39;t see what&#39;s really going on!!<sep>Hypocrite 😂😂😂<sep>It&#39;s just Google, people.  Easy to look up.<br>2019 average, pre-pandemic, $2.60.  2020 average, the country was shut down, so low demand and low prices, $2.19.  January of 2024, average is $3.04.  So, up 44 cents from a regular year and 85 cents from the pandemic lows.  Either way, not $2.<br>The oil companies made record profits the last few years to the public&#39;s pain.  These profits were reported and in the news for anyone who bothered to read.<br>Big Oil is NOT the friend of America or the American consumer.  They should be; they could have sold to America cheaper than to overseas but they chose not to.<sep>Private companies and private citizens tell YOU what to do, Mr. Political Parasite since 1972. You haven’t worked an honest day in your life<sep>he&#39;s not changing the tax code.<sep>You made room for them and they took advantage of it.. you increase their tax, they increase the price and the consumers indirectly  pays the tax...<br>Joe go and rest. Noice noice noice.... The fact is you are too busy caring so much for illegal immigrants while you careless for we the people.<sep>Everything about crooked joe is Lies lies lies 😢😂<sep>How much kickback did you get from Ukraine in the last 200 days?<sep>Wait isn&#39;t he one of those who benefited? <br>What about how he lied during the last election cycle about his son under oath?<sep>How much do you make from China and Ukraine?<sep>Dont forget...<br>NO MORE SUBSIDIES!<sep>Bidens policy caused this<sep>You&#39;re not drilling. We are using reserves<sep>It would be nice if what he say about them paying higher tax is true. Except they will burn us at the pump if taxed.<sep>and its all ur fault 😂😂 he forgot to add that it is his fault<sep>Its your fault crooked corrupt joe. FJB. TRUMP 2024<sep>Please, just shut up for once. We are done with your incoherent woke babble that has left this once proud country in ruins.<sep>Yep make them pay taxes<sep>There all corrupt.

He knew it much ealier,any way rising the taxes for company never be reality.Lets follow what he realy gona do about it,i bed he already forgot  about it<sep>It took him 6 months to woke up,<br>But the gas price has been high for the last 3 years, he has no idea where he’s at. 😂😂😂<sep>Because of you!

84b97qSl0po,Putin Warns Poland ‘Aggression’ Toward Belarus Is Attack on Russia,"Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Poland that he would treat any “aggression” toward ally Belarus as an attack on his own country, following Warsaw’s decision to send troops to reinforce its eastern border in response to the presence of Wagner mercenary forces in its neighbor.“Aggression against Belarus will mean aggression against the Russian Federation,” Putin said in televised comments during a Security Council Meeting Friday. “We will respond to this with all the means at our disposal,” he said, referencing a long-established union state between Belarus and Russia.The threats, which could exacerbate tensions between Russia and Europe, aren’t the first the Kremlin has leveled against Poland, which is one of Kyiv’s biggest supporters in the war with Russia. Poland is a member of NATO and has shown no intention to take unilateral, unprovoked military action.--------Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmSubscribe to Bloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/BloombergTVBloomberg Quicktake brings you global social video spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

I received it at least 66 times.<sep>Like we are going to vote for a senile nursing patient to cause another 4 years of terrible cost of living, border crises and wars he probably won’t even live to see another 4 years, FJB 😂<sep>Republicans are trying to make women second class citizens again! Women in America will show Republicans NEVER to mess with their rights!!<sep>Meanwhile, Roe v. Wade could&#39;ve been codified into law, especially when the Obama administration had a democratic majority in the House and Senate, but the democrats didn&#39;t push for the codification of law.<sep>Biden needs notecards for everything for 3 years now<sep>And so amazing how no one now mentions Ruth bader Ginsburg who was for the same thing! Hypocrisy<sep>Trump doesn&#39;t want to ban abortion worldwide. You flipped liars Biden<sep>Yes Trump ban abortion please!! I’m glad you overturned roe v wade Trump 2024!!!<sep>Joe Biden , Supporting the ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the bombing of embassies in foreign countries, According to this geriatric fool.. &#39;&#39; Izrael can do no wrong&#39;&#39;.

Wade was overturned in 2022…<sep>Biden 2024 🇺🇸🗽💙 Vote BLUE America!  🇺🇸🗽💙<sep>Can it old man 🤡🤡🤡<sep>Thank you, Joe. Maybe the best president of my lifetime ❤<sep>Roe v Wade was only decided in 1973. He got the number of years wrong<sep>The wanna be dictator is horrible for taking away women&#39;s right to decide what they do with their bodies, but how about fixing the abortion issue now, permanently instead of keeping it a crutch to fight Republicans with.<sep>Trump doesn’t support women even though he has a wife💀<sep>If we don&#39;t stop them here, they won&#39;t stop here either. I know Clarence Thomas was talking about getting rid of contraceptives too. Now there&#39;s talk on the right of getting rid of no-fault divorce.<br><br>We need to stop them this November. Please make sure you&#39;re registered to vote 💙<sep>Sir, men do not tell women what to do any longer, Biden 2024. 💙<sep>So many illegal aliens bots here 😨<sep>Biden medically blackmailed everyone while i was in service. He lost Afghanistan before we even left the country. I abandoned my pension at 17 years rather than serve under this clown. I hope karma brings him what he deserves. Meanwhile i&#39;ll bring a vote for Trump this year. Get your lap dogs busy deleting comments. You are despised.<sep>They tell you what you want to hear and mfs turn a blind eye<sep>Here&#39;s the real argument: Lawmakers don&#39;t know the patient, they aren&#39;t trained as any kind of physicians. They should not be making medical decisions for the patient.<sep>Trump has nearly 3 million subscribers and Biden doesn’t even have a million 😂<sep>Glad you are doing it now, but they told you what they were planning for 50 years!! How many times could you have already done this?<sep>Trump: &quot;Where were you, sleepy Joe?&quot;<br><br>Joe: &quot;Sorry, i had to record a dumb video because my teleprompter said so.&quot;<br><br>Obama: &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get back on the minecraft server.&quot;<sep>Trump 2024! Because he is more intelligent than Biden. With Biden, the western world will be plagued by never ending inflation and impoverishment! WITH BIDEN, YOU WILL BE POORER!<sep>I trust anyone ,the best way.<sep>If you&#39;re voting according to Roe v Wade you&#39;re on the spectrum<sep>Trump 2026<sep>Trump doesn&#39;t want to be controlled in the courtroom.... Women don&#39;t want to be controlled in the Exam room. Trump can whitewash and blame states for imposing the law but Trump..... THE WORLD KNOWS YOU. Vote 💙<sep>Biden, another faux Catholic who supports abortion.<sep>mew<sep>Trump 2024<sep>Liars , economy busters, crime friendly, homelessness and drug pushers, border mess, pricing out of control… worst president ever… vote Republican<sep>It&#39;s false information, we now have Trumps official endorsement to abortion saying it is the states right to choose meaning a woman can always get an abortion within some states. He has never endorsed a nation-wide ban on abortion.<sep>that’s a lie trump said he would leave it up to the states<sep>Joe biden belongs in a old folks home! and on abortion it&#39;s  simple take Birth control or abort after a month or two not till the baby is fully developed how hard is that( but its my body) shut the F up there is no excuse! After 8 month it&#39;s pure homcide, He said nothing about banning it this is ridiculous at this point! Trump said 6 times now he is leaving it up the states to decided Democrats lying again typical career politicans and there fake narratives and this leftists believe it and lack logic and common sense. I hope trump wins.<sep>Man, you are doing a great job selling Trump! 😎🤘<sep>where are the weapons for Ukraine?, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons, America&#39;s words are worthless, where is Lend Lease? Ukraine needs patriots, History will remember America&#39;s indecisiveness and weakness<sep>4 more years trump is a joke go straight to jail 😂<sep>I want to live in a free country.    Not in a fascist  country.   Im voting for Jo biden.     🎉<sep>TRUMP 2024!!! 🇺🇸 ❤️<sep>The choice is very simple in November, you either support women’s rights or you don’t! Please vote BLUE until the cows come home and protect our democracy!!<sep>Unfortunately, the script from this video is the failed talking points of the media. Very disingenuous at best. Now the truth -  Biden’s record to date; a botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, Inflation with sharply higher costs for everything, Profligate spending that has put the country deeper in debt, Open US borders allowing 10+ million illegals to pour in, An unprecedented increase in crime and opioid usage, Total ineffectiveness overseas in Ukraine, Gaza and Iran.  Biden tends to blame everything on Trump.  These monumental failures happened on Biden&#39;s watch.<sep>Trump&#39;s not running to ban abortion nationally. At least, that&#39;s what he says this week. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll change again by the convention, and probably pivot back at least once.<sep>FJB -  Failure In Chief only has SMEAR and FEAR as his campaign strategy.  He has NO accomplishments to run on!<sep>Go Joe, kick that maniac out of the game, because you are thousands of times better than him.<sep>It is already much if we can say that Trump Love Women...<br>Trusting would have a Pre marriage agreement Paperwork Short of Few Pages...<sep>Biden24<sep>What is a woman?<sep>Joe Biden also tried to force people to inject a vaccine into their body they didnt want. My body my choice right joe?<sep>AMERICANS YOU MUST VOTE IN NOVEMBER  💙<sep>VOTE BIDEN  /  HARRIS  TO PRESERVE THE DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES  🇺🇸   😊<sep>It may be the deciding factor on who wins the White House<sep>Fight fascist embrace freedom and vote Biden 2024<sep>Ok he said he trust woman, than what is a woman?",0

XnEbAzcgQI4,⚠️ A Reminder from Neil deGrasse Tyson ⚠️ #startalk,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnEbAzcgQI4,"Udain top speed is 27.8 . Facts are important<sep>0mph?<sep>Who CARES!!!<sep>👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿<sep>I can attest to both sides of this. I flipped a pickup going between 40-60mph and my passenger was buckled while my dog and I weren&#39;t and the dog was fine and the passenger however I would have been crushed if I wasn&#39;t ejected so it did save my life in a way. But wearing a seatbelt definitely saved me in a front end crash going 40mph.<sep>Hahaha 👍😁 love it the you....<sep>I always wear my seatbelt unless I am driving on a frozen lake. Seatbelt is off and the door is unlocked. I typically have the window down as well.<sep>This guy is a great presenter of ANY information!<sep>but in a car you have your arms and legs braced...so it is NOT the same as a sprinter running into a brick wall face first, or even if they use their arms to brace the impact.  In a car you have arms and legs braced...25mph collision is nothing  I do it all the time.<sep>What about 1 MPH???<sep>my life my choice. what happened to that.<sep>Unbelted, one might avoid damage from a vehicle crash if the combined opposing speed of the involved vehicles don’t exeed 4,3 mph…<sep>what ubout 1 inc pêr sec<sep>Neil didn&#39;t take into account that I&#39;m a psychopath.<sep>I respect this man very much<sep>Sir Dr. Neil is out here saving lives.<sep>Yeah if you crash<sep>I feel wrong getting into my car an not putting my seatbealt on.<br><br>Not to mention my car will yell at me until i do<sep>How about if you are going c ?<sep>those rules don&#39;t apply to school children on school buses, they don&#39;t apply to any public transportation, explain the physics that makes those rules only true with private transportation.<sep>I don&#39;t wear my seatbelt when I&#39;m in a parking lot. I don&#39;t just turn my head, I&#39;m leaning forward as well as side to side. The moment I&#39;m at the street I put it on. I drive large vehicles and it can be hard to see my blind spots if the seatbelt is pressing me against the seat.<sep>Someone tell Neil he needs to get him a car with an airbag. There is no reason why at 35 miles an hour your face should go from the driver seat to the windshield. Also, I can probably go 35 mph on a bike. Should I be installing a seatbelt for that too?<sep>I always wore my seat belt. Because expect the unexpected and 169 euro or 182 dollar fine, if caught not wearing your seat belt.<sep>I don’t wear seat belts. <br>My Street Glide didn’t come with one<sep>I put that belt on as soon as I get in<sep>I always wear my seatbelt everytime i get into the car!<sep>😂😂<sep>In the mid 70&#39;s when I bought my first car the first thing I did was buckle up. That&#39;s been a habit with me every since. The idea of that second collision didn&#39;t appeal to me.<sep>I hit a Drystone wall at 70 without a seatbelt, my head destroyed the steering wheel but I did get out of the car laughing, for a short time.<sep>Tell that to my schmuck next door neighbor<sep>Yeah and most of the time People are hitting other cars that are driving towards them. So now you have to add their speed to yours. So now 2 cars driving 25 MPH hit each other head on is a 50 MPH impact. 🥴<sep>I put my seatbelt on before I do anything else in the car. I put my seatbelt to move my car from the driveway to the street<sep>Guess we all have different experiences, my personal story involves me at 16yrs old loosing my sister because her car was sideswiped by a drunk driver and she past 30min later because the seatbelt broke multiple ribs puncturing multiple holes in her lungs. Later in life I crashed a vehicle going over 100mph and didn&#39;t have any injuries besides a sprained ankle and I wasn&#39;t wearing a seatbelt. I will always see the situation as if it&#39;s your day to go then it&#39;s happening. Also &quot;only the good die young&quot; is a very true statement 😎<sep>The only time i dont wear a seatbelt is perhaps for 2 secs when im a passenger and we&#39;re pulling out of a parking space or drive way. Otherwise, always wear your seatbelt. <br><br>Also, don&#39;t wear a seatbelt after you fall into water please<sep>0.1 miles an hour<sep>Allways have you&#39;r ,seetbelt on.<br> Unless you&#39;re on a motorcycle. Then no.<sep>Isn&#39;t getting into an accident at 25 MPH like free falling two stories? I&#39;ll take the half second to buckle up, thank you very much.<sep>The windshield breaks your face*<sep>I started wearing seat belts in 1967 maybe a little earlier and shoulder straps when I bought my first Volvo a 1963 122S which came with  factory installed three point restraints In a few years I started buckling up just to back down the driveway. This is what everyone must do. Unless you want to play the part of a just launched missle when you accidentally hit an immovable object.<sep>Fax<sep>I do it because it&#39;s law, and getting pulled over and fined over a seatbelt is pretty dumb<sep>I wear my seatbelt all the time so I save on getting a ticket. Yes iv got a seatbelt tick and had to go to a class we&#39;re they show you video of crashes n stuff.<sep>I was almost killed not wearing a seatbelt. I don’t have memory of the entire night but I was “too cool” for seatbelts in cars with my friends at 16/17. I always felt like I didn’t need a seatbelt in the backseat, which is a weird way to think. I broke my neck, fractured my skull in multiple places, was in a coma, was taken by helicopter to the hospital, and in the hospital for months. Today I’m a 29 year old mom to a 3 year old and I’m lucky to be alive!<sep>My car would make me wear mine. Which I do anyway. High school physics.<sep>Better yet, you’re going 25 mph and have a head on collision with another car going the opposite direction 25 miles an hour. That’s like hitting a brick wall at 50 miles an hour! And better yet try this with a motorcycle! With no helmet!<sep>STICK TO THE STARS NEIL !! 🙏🏼🙏🏼<sep>what about 5 MPH?<sep>I remember when you didn&#39;t have to wear a seatbelt.  That was in the 1970s right here in New York City.<sep>Preach Neil! Thank you!<sep>Today, Neil has taught me that if i hit a brick wall going 2 mph without a seatbelt on, i will go through the wall.<sep>PSA Nobel prize goes to…. Neil!<sep>The more you know 🌈<sep>It&#39;s the LAW...of motion<sep>Not to mention the guy about to slam into you is going 65.<sep>I was going to say when you ingress and egress from the vehicle. That’s the only time it’s not safe to wear your seatbelt!😂<sep>You don&#39;t have to move at all if sombody else crushes into you from behind. Or the front.<sep>&quot;What happened?&quot;<br>&quot;My parents died.&quot;<br>&quot;What!! HOW!!!&quot;<br>&quot;They were in the car, and they weren&#39;t wearing a seatbelt. I didn&#39;t die because I was wearing a seatbelt, but my parents died because they weren&#39;t wearing their seatbelts.&quot;<sep>True, but I know one person who would have died wearing a seatbelt but survived because he was not wearing one.    It was a strange incident but he would have been crushed inside, instead of being able to get out.    Slid and rolled across 4 lanes and the median down into a ditch.   Took the police 10 min. to find him, banged up, but not impaled by steering wheel and seat.<sep>A seat belt didn&#39;t save my neighbor&#39;s life. She got rear ended while stopped for a school bus.<sep>We know that Princess Diana would have survived that car crash if she had worn a seatbelt.   Since then, I always wear a seatbelt in the backseat of a car.<sep>Logical weirdness: “there is no speed where it isn’t safe to wear a seat belt.” Ok, but I don’t think anyone is arguing that. Mostly the argument is that “there IS a speed where it is (also) safe to NOT wear a seat belt.” Proving the safety of wearing a seat belt at all speeds does not, on its own, prove that it is dangerous not to wear one at certain speeds.<sep>Well at least the new windshields no longer allow the head to go through the windshield and then create the &quot;windshield neck tie&quot;<sep>Dear Doctor . . . So you are vociferously defending the Stoopids Laws that have directly lowered the i.q. of America.<br>Stoopids Laws that protect the Stoopids so they can and have bred with other Stoopids and begat little Stoopids<br>Did you ever stop to think about just letting them live out their lives in your basement?<sep>But Dr. Tyson... You are using science and logic. Many people can&#39;t get grip on reality these days 😅. I&#39;m still glad you are trying. Thank you<sep>I imagine this is his response when you&#39;re at the grocery store and he&#39;s been staring at the beans you want to buy for several minutes.<sep>2 miles an hr is safe to hit a wall.<sep>I&#39;m a 100% seatbelt wearer. The other day I had to get something from the trunk then went into the car wash. My car hollered at me as I drove around the curve from the gate to the car wash. Don&#39;t non seat belt wearers get tired of their cars hollering at them?<sep>&quot;Unsafe at any Speed.&quot;<sep>Smoking and drinking - let&#39;s promote it.<br>Wearing seatbelt - let&#39;s enforce it.<br><br>Make it make sense.<sep>I don’t buses have seatbelts 😅<sep>Ouch<sep>I dont know what is a mile<sep>It&#39;s sad that this is an actual video.<sep>Well at 30 mph you probably won’t die… probably. You won’t be very happy though.<br><br>Ever fall down a flight of stairs? Hurts doesn’t it? Now do it at 5x speed, then add glass and sharp metal.<sep>Or in a T-bone collision you hit your head to the A-pillar fatally (opposing car driver), you fly out of the door (step-brother, 6) or slide down to the foot space (me, 5). The strangest fact is, that the doors were closed when we started to evacuate. My step brother fell into a pile of snow that softened his landing. And he had to have flown over me.<br><br>Yup, every future car had seat belts in the back, too. And I never drive, if someone is not using the seat belt.<sep>so well said - as usual :). and, boy was that clear to anyone!!  (although i always wear them. am not an idiot, but i love the running analogy.) <br><br>i just love your logical, straight ahead thinking.  you take complex, to me anyway, principles of physics and explain them so simply, i always have an “aha” experience.  much, much heartfelt, friendly air kisses to you. You are an amazing teaching person :) 🌷🌱<sep>Na, I&#39;m good. If it&#39;s my time, it&#39;s my time<sep>The Trooper teaching my Defensive Driving class (I had to take because of youthful poor decision-making) made a good point.  The seatbelt will not only save you in the event of an accident, it may prevent the accident altogether by keeping you in your seat at the controls rather than thrown into the passenger seat (or worse) by inertia when you swerve to miss having the accident.<sep>Safety propaganda, don&#39;t believe the mainstream media<sep>From high school in the 70s: Some kids would say &quot;we&#39;re not going very far, I don&#39;t need my seatbelt because it&#39;s only five blocks&quot;, etc. Some voice of authority said, &quot;If you think it&#39;s close enough that you don&#39;t have to wear your seatbelt, it&#39;s close enough to WALK.  If it&#39;s too far that you&#39;re not WALKING, that&#39;s far enough to wear your seatbelt.<sep>My driving school had a ramp with a sliding car seat that would accelerate to around 10-15kph (very slow mph) and then it would come to an abrupt stop, not as abrupt as a real car crash but it was pretty violent and let me tell you it felt like how i imagined crashing at 40-50kph or around how fast you would drive in a town.<br>I learned then that you should always wear your seatbelt no matter how slow you are going<sep>There&#39;s also the fact that other cars might be going faster than you are and they might hit you. <br>But really when it comes down to it, it takes a second or two to put on a seatbelt, a second or two for a piece of safety equipment that doesn&#39;t impact anything you&#39;re doing but could save your life. It makes no sense not to do it. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a ticking clock amd you have a choice tp put on a full harness, no, you have the time no matter how busy you are to put on a seat beat. So stop being a child and just do it.<sep>I DON’T wear a seatbelt driving across a frozen Wisconsin lake. Because, you know.🌊<sep>Lost many people from high school due to not wearing a seatbelt. I get it&#39;s uncomfortable but the more you do it the more of a habit of becomes and you don&#39;t even notice it&#39;s there anymore.<sep>Inertia.<sep>I mean. If you&#39;re going over 100mph you probably dont want to survive that wreck. That is when seatbelt should come off<sep>I still think they could use a bit more engineering. Some people die and they had their seat belt applied improperly.<sep>My ex was running from the police and our car caught on fire, in a spilt second I decided that jumping out and possibly surviving was infinitely better than burning alive. He was going 35mph AT LEAST so I opened the door and (without thinking) planted my feet on the ground…by the time I did that my upper body was 5/6ft infront of me and it knocked me to the ground so fast it was like a punch to the gut. I hit my head pretty hard but thankfully I had no injuries no broken bones nothing. Don’t do what I did, just tuck and roll if you MUST jump out of anything moving, protect your head cuz the force is unreal even when you aren’t going “that fast”<sep>What if I&#39;m going 2.5mph? Can I then forego my seatbelt?<sep>45 years of using a seat belt every single time. And counting.<sep>How bout if you only put it on when you see a cop! 🤣<sep>Not if you break the wall<sep>We south indians put seat belt before starting our car to avoid police giving fine 😂.<sep>I always wear a seat belt yesterday a deer ran in front of my dads truck he hit the break&#39;s if I didn&#39;t have a seat belt I probably would have gotten hurt bad<sep>Thank You For This short!<br>Yes always wear a SEATBELT!<br>Seatbelts SAVE LIVE&#39;S ! <br>Pre Seatbelt days/ children&#39;s<br>Car seats ! I survived car accident in 1961 Because my older sister was holding on to me 1 1/2 years old .<br>She absorbed part of the impact Of accident an didn&#39;t survive. I always wear a seatbelt. PS  I don&#39;t Drive !<sep>Damn you, physics<sep>Let’s go 120!!<sep>And THEN we can get into speed!! 🤦🏿‍♂️😪 😤<sep>🤣🤣🤣 It’s the most funniest bit of logic I can think of when inertia is involved!! It may not seem like much but if you’ve ever manufactured or distributed tires 🛞 , you know a tire by itself is made to bounce off of solid surfaces. A human body IS NOT!! And then there’s the density, mass, and overall weight of the solid. 🤷🏾‍♂️ but 🤷🏾‍♂️ what do I know?<sep>Ok Mr Tyson I got a solution. Alcohol. Beats seat belts any day",0

You need another conservative candidate.<sep>Isso que é um presidente de verdade, que ama o seu país, que não tem medo de falar as coisas ruins que outros países fazem, países como a China.<sep>🙏👍❤🇺🇸<sep>I  say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement: and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, THOU FOOL, shall be in danger of HELL FIRE!!! I&#39;m comin for ya satan! Your end is near(: <br><br>O death, how you have hid yourself in the depths of the Seas. Although, I have found the presence of many beautiful things around you. Yet, you have immersed yourself in places not known to man. But I, your Master, have rediscovered your whereabouts. Only to find that you have lost your sting on not only mankind, but my Beloved planet entirely. Since the foundations of creation were laid, your predecessor made you his choice protégée, using you in all of his most secret and heinous schemes. He adored you and made you one with himself. Notwithstanding his need for your assistance, he hated you as much as himself. For he is the epitome of hate, which makes you the same as well. Moreover, your brother fear and your sister lust have used you likewise, only to empower you to the point that you became the one I hate most. I repent not at your calamity, and give praise to the day of your destruction. For that is what you are, destruction itself. I bet you never thought I would use your very nature as the one thing to eliminate you. You have annihilated nations, governments, families, marriages, friendships, wildlife, vegetation, and all other forms of life and goodness. You have forsaken the ordinances of Heaven and therefor created havoc on Earth. You have taken far too many of my sons and caused them to descend down into the pit. Providently, the grace of God, the Father of all things has given me the seal of approval to resurrect them all, leaving you, your father pride, and all other sadistic principalities formless and void. To be specific, you are without an Earthly home. I am sending the collection of you all beyond the cosmic horizon, where you will find the great lake of fire, the abyss. Upon arrival you shall regain form while being forced into the designated bodies I have created for you. Why? Because you must suffer. Once each of you have found your extra-terrestrial temple, I will slowly but surely dip and submerge you into the place where you shall abode forevermore, leaving no trace of sin, or darkness, or hate, or death to consume our Universe ever again.<sep>This clown is a gift to the Biden Campaign<sep>Donald belongs in jail ….🔓🔓🔓👮🏽👮🏽👮🏽👮🏽<sep>Just experienced this with my local pharmacy<sep>💯CORRECT DAY <br>WAS SEPTEMBER  8  <br>IN THE  EVENING <br>CHECK SECURITY <br>CAMERAS <br>BECAUSE <br>I TOLD <br>THEM <br>TO <br>TELL <br>YOU <br>WHO <br>I WAS <br>THEY <br>SMILE <br>HAPPY <br>BUT <br>THEY <br>TOLD <br>ME <br>THEY <br>WAS <br>GOING <br>TO <br>LET <br>YOU <br>KNOW <br>AQUARIUS <br>MITCHELL  <br>NATURE <br>GIRL <br>TRAVEL <br>FAR <br>TO <br>SEE <br>YOU <br>BEAUTIFUL <br>💯LOVELY<sep>It’s all because of chicken legs Biden!<sep>MUCH LOVE💯 <br>PRESIDENT TRUMP <br>ASK YOUR POLICE MAN <br>POLICE WOMEN <br>THEY WILL TELL YOU <br>I WAS AT YOUR HOME <br>ON SATURDAY  <br>TO <br>TELL <br>YOU <br>I BELIEVE <br>YOU <br>THE <br>ONLY <br>BEST <br>YOU <br>WANT <br>FOR USA <br>HUMANITY<sep>Get your ass back in the White House mister....we mean it!! <br>Actually, the whole world needs it. 🧡<sep>These videos are angering the left, and I couldn’t be happier!!

For example, the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; (General Plan East) was a Nazi plan for the colonization and exploitation of Eastern Europe. Additionally, the term &quot;Aktion&quot; followed by numbers was often used to refer to specific operations or campaigns, such as &quot;Aktion T4&quot; which was the program for mass murder of disabled individuals.

Please have us in your minds, just please<sep>Numbers don&#39;t lie, or so we&#39;re told<sep>TRUMP 2024 ❤️🇺🇸<sep>Since the enactment of China&#39;s anti-espionage law, there have been many cases of foreigners being detained or arrested in China.  Because &quot;suspicious espionage&quot; is mainly handled not only by public security but also by the National Security Agency, the interrogation is the most severe and the detention environment is inhumane.<br>Following the passage of the Anti-Espionage Law, the local government&#39;s National Security Office enacted rules encouraging reporting of &quot;espionage.&quot;  Since 2017, the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau has been offering rewards of up to 500,000 yuan (8.5 million yen; 645,400 US dollars) to encourage the informant system.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>It is a situation in which even Chinese people can be accused of &quot;violating the law&quot; simply by contributing to foreign newspapers or responding to interviews on foreign television.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br> Anti-espionage law (Counter-espionage Law) is a law that regulates activities such as the National Security Agency, which was enacted in 2014 to crack down on &quot;espionage activities&quot;.<br>At the end of 2022, the Chinese government expanded the definition of &quot;espionage&quot; from the current law.  He announced a plan to expand the &quot;anti-espionage law&quot; to strengthen the authority of the National Security Agency, which leads the crackdown, and penalties for those arrested.  An expanded anti-espionage law was passed in July 2023.<br>The proposed expansion of the Anti-Espionage Law requires that state secret information be provided to a third party in a concrete manner as it is, and that documents and materials related to state secrets that may adversely affect national security or interests. Providing and &quot;stealing&quot; will also fall under &quot;espionage&quot;.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>The proposed expansion of the &quot;anti-espionage law&quot; would greatly increase the powers of the National Security Agency, the agency that is responsible for the investigation, and could, for example, force tests on those targeted for &quot;espionage&quot; and ban them from leaving the country.  Depending on the judgment of the National Security Agency, an extremely wide range of &quot;information leaks&quot; will be covered, and cases such as public information leaked from private companies and public institutions that do not comply with the intentions of the National Security Agency will be exposed.<br>And if a person refuses an information request from the National Security Agency for &quot;espionage&quot; by a colleague or another person, that person can at least be fined.<br>The proposed expansion of the &quot;anti-espionage law&quot; would allow the Chinese government to unfairly detain Japanese and foreigners in China, increasing scrutiny of Japanese and foreigners in China.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br><br>A university professor was suddenly detained just before returning to Japan, and an appeal by a Japanese sentenced to prison was easily dismissed by the court. As the number of people has increased, the number of Japanese and foreigners who will be arrested will increase in the future due to the expansion of the definition of the &quot;anti-espionage law&quot;.<br>The Chinese government will give the State Security Agency the power to search the bags of those suspected of &quot;espionage&quot; and to bar citizens from leaving the country who may &quot;endanger&quot; national security.  A “fine” is imposed for refusing to provide evidence of spying on others.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>In addition to the provision of &quot;state secrets&quot; under the current law, the proposed expansion of &quot;espionage&quot; includes &quot;stealing&quot; and &quot;collecting&quot; &quot;other documents, data, materials, and goods related to national security and interests, etc.  There is no mention of what is contrary to national security or interests.<br>Collecting information about Chinese companies and collecting historical materials are also considered &quot;espionage&quot; if the National Security Administration determines that they are against &quot;national interests.&quot;<br> In the political report of the Communist Party Congress in October last year, Xi Jinping repeatedly referred to “national security,” calling on party members to “perform a comprehensive view of national security.”  This &quot;security view&quot; presented in 2014 covers 11 items, including &quot;politics,&quot; national land, military affairs, economy, and &quot;culture.&quot;<br> “Political security” refers to the maintenance and stability of the Communist Party regime.  In China, where there is no alternative to the Communist Party, there is a perception that if the party loses power, the country will split and fall into chaos.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>The powers of the National Security Agency are endlessly strengthened.  The expanded proposal stipulates that electronic devices, equipment and programs of persons or organizations suspected of espionage can also be investigated.<br>Many researchers and business people with connections to China will be affected by the proposed expansion.<br>There are 17 Japanese detained in connection with the &quot;anti-espionage law.&quot;  In the future, this number will undoubtedly increase.  Foreign researchers may be detained if they conduct research in China.<br>Xi Jinping has strengthened his stance of emphasizing &quot;national security,&quot; but the definition is ambiguous, and the government&#39;s arbitrary judgment is subject to exposure.  In China, the Communist Party exists above the law.  The proposed expansion of the &quot;anti-espionage law&quot; plays a greater role in keeping things out of China.  Japanese and foreigners visiting China run the risk of being detained.<br><br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br><br>In China, (1) the state can force Chinese nationals at home and abroad to carry out military activities in their respective countries (National Defense Mobilization Law, effective in 2010); (2) the state can force Chinese nationals at home and abroad to do spy activities in their respective countries. (National Intelligence Law, effective 2017).  Chinese citizens who do not follow the instructions and orders of the Chinese government will be arrested and have no option to decline.  <br>Together, these two laws create the most dangerous security situation for every country.<br><br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br><br>The world will decouple from China and Russia.<br><br>The world will put the most severe economic sanctios on China as we do on Russia. <br><br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦🇪🇺🇯🇵<sep>Donald Trump Verma<br>.Verma ....Verma ......Verma<sep>🟧 TREAT TRUMP FAIRY 🟧<br> ⚫️ LOCK HIM UP NOW ⚫️😊<sep>Trump dump Lindsey Graham or I am voting for Vivek<sep>Trump University<sep>Take China out of America!

That voice is fantastic too!<sep>no, this is not how it works &quot;in the universe&quot;, only on our own tiny speck of cosmic dust we call earth...<sep>Crazy how much we miss the sun here in the north. At the equator however, it’s sunny most days of the year. A lack of sun is depressing but a lot of sun can give you skin cancers. My grandmother died of skin cancer and I’ve learned to respect the sun for that reason.<sep>That definition doesn&#39;t make any sense since there usually is far more summer in June than in September, at least at high latitudes.<sep>Judging by the comments I think everyone&#39;s very confused and don&#39;t understand at all<sep>As a person whose friend is nicknamed &quot;Equinox&quot;, darn I forgot to post a spring fanart<sep>Malaysia<sep>How do you think about these things 😅<sep>Well,, I think,, that, you can do much better than ThaT, oOR, Can you?<sep>The equator has wet a <br>and dry season.<sep>Wait so it hot year round in Africa bruhhh I feel like an idiot. I never thought to look into it<sep>Only the american hemisphere has the fall. Everyone else has autumn.<sep>❤ science!<sep>That&#39;s how it works in the universe?  I don&#39;t know about that, but it is definitely how it works on this planet in this universe.<sep>Actually we are transitioning int Autumn...<sep>Booo<sep>This is incorrect. The southern hemisphere is not transitioning in to the &quot;fall&quot;, because it&#39;s only North Americans who refer to autumn as the &quot;fall&quot;, and North America does not extend to the southern hemisphere. Why do americans think the whole world.. you know, the OTHER 96% of the world&#39;s population, does things their way. They don&#39;t.<sep>Tyson said the equator is S.O.L...did he mean &quot; Sol&quot;  like Sun. I don&#39;t think he meant Shizzle outta luck...because the equator just gets the Summer sun...no winter, no spring<sep>God forgot about Equator 😂<sep>65 years old and now I learn this.<sep>Glad I dont live on the equator.<br>I like variety<sep>How do flat-earthers explain that?<sep>is he feeling sorry for equator? equator is where even poor people can live comfortable. <br>feel sorry for inconsistence of north and south, where you can be killed by weather. <br>equator is the best place to live, you never have to worry about the weather  <br> if you don&#39;t live in equator and near by, your life is misery.<sep>Got a question?Ask Neil.<sep>India transition SUMMER to SUMMER<sep>En Panamá tenemos la temporada seca y lluviosa. La temporada seca siempre coincide con el invierno del norte. Según entiendo tiene que ver con las corrientes frías que bajan del norte y disminuyen la humedad del aire.<sep>Tropical Thailand has hot, wet &amp; cool.<sep>In Spanish there are two different words for this: temporada and estaciones<sep>What’s S.O.L?<sep>In the Philippines there&#39;s only rainy season and sunny season 😭<sep>We here on Colombia (4.72°) we are starting the weather what my grandma calls: &quot;abril, lluvias mil&quot; starting the rains<sep>I live in Kenya, Maseno to be specific bang on the Equator<sep>No we have season in the equater<sep>and that really suck<sep>We have harmattan and Rain<sep>Sol?<sep>Oh, they got something on the equator. It’s called beautiful weather all year long.<br>Lol<sep>Tried to search and find out what S.O.L means. No luck. I&#39;ll settle for &quot;Sorry One-Liner&quot;<sep>SOL seasons out of luck 😂<sep>You no nothing<sep>In the southern hemisphere, its called autumn not fall. But yes.<sep>Mr. deGrasse: <br>Closer to the Ecuador, there are 2 seasons: rainy season and dry season.<sep>In Bali we have wet &amp; dry season. <br>And if the temperature drop by 2 degrees everyone would rugged up like they&#39;re about to go to Antarctica lol 😂😂😂😂<sep>Mostly.. In the southenr hemisphere we dont have a fall.. unless we fall over.. We have Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn.. What is this FALL you speak of?  the FALL of Pluto?  OH im sure you remember that part :p<sep>Australians have summer in december and winter in june. Somebody help me<sep>That&#39;s right. In the equator it&#39;s summer all year long<sep>but they call that thing u say &quot;fall/autumn&quot; as spring<sep>Oh yea well, PLUTO IS A PLANET 😮<sep>As a Colombian living in US, I appreciate the seasons, however I miss the weather on the eternal Spring City of  Medellin<sep>How are they balanced?<sep>Every scientist can explain how the equinoxes and several other phenomena happen, but no one can explain their origin!!!<br>Case closed!!!<sep>We live in heaven here at the equator. It can be anything any time 😅 There&#39;s rain even in the dry season,❤🇺🇬 Uganda<sep>This guy never stops with these profound insights. I would have never known this.<sep>We have wet season and dry season.<sep>I live in Uganda, along the equator. Always summer!<sep>Plot: He came to Florida with pair of skis<sep>It&#39;s the sun here all year round. Taunting me from above. If only I can be so grossly incandescent.<sep>Note, we have the wet and dry season. Thanks.<sep>Autumn in SH😊<sep>I ordy no that from the time  ther somthing  I think wider  som haw give me idea  cud thay chang wother  time<sep>And 1 time in hundred years, there is no leap year.  The next one will be in 2100. It is called a century year.<sep>Here in the southern hemisphere we are in autumn - we don’t call it fall down under<sep>SOL = Seasons On Leave, btw.<sep>I&#39;m from Hawaii. It&#39;s literally always summer or spring weather. Our winters are when it rains for a couple days straight. Lucky we live Hawaii!<sep>here is sri lanka its just hot,<sep>As a Kenyan, our country is split into 2 by the equator which runs through it. It’s amazing to not have seasons and I miss that after experiencing all 4 seasons in UK. It’s amazing to have consistent 12 hrs of daylight and 12 hrs of dark each day every day<sep>Living in SEA I can confirm that equator is always summer🔥🔥🔥<sep>Try explaining that on a flat earth!<sep>Afghanistan is in equator line, but we&#39;ve four seasons.<br><br>The truth is I didn&#39;t understand this clip completely. Who can explain it to me ? <br>Thanks in advance<sep>In tropical it&#39;s the Wet or the Dry<sep>I moved to Florida from Colorado. I regret every minute. I miss the snow and the colors<sep>Actually, we have 2 seasons. The dry season and the rainy season.<sep>Such Revolutionary ideas.😐<sep>Love you Neil 😊<sep>Equatorial folks still have to contend with the rainy season.<sep>But NOT on Uranus 😅<sep>So.... do trees on the equator have rings?<sep>Here in the southern hemisphere we are going into autumn not fall 😂<sep>The equator has night falling --- BOOM! None of those long, leisurely sunsets on the beach the travel ads would imply.<br>By contrast, my temperate location has such a lovely, long sunset/twilight, but we have to wait for summer to truly appreciate it.🏖<sep>🇰🇪<sep>How the weather? Same.. it&#39;s always the same 😀<sep>Republicans dont believe in this<sep>I can’t believe I didn’t know that about the equator<sep>Wet season and dry sesean<sep>Autumn... not fall. 🎉<sep>I&#39;d love to believe that.... At 1deg north we R sweltering... We get summer and winter.<sep>Like Singapore we only have dry and wet season and monsoon season lol<sep>Love to hang out w Neil.<sep>your telling me the equator has no seasons at all even with the tilt of earth?<sep>Autumn<sep>I would take the equator any time of the year. I’m done with winter on Dec. 26 !<sep>Basically an electron is made up of really condensed pieces of its fields smoke liquid energy and these are probably little round piece&#39;s of energy....<br><br>😂😂 that are inside the electron and they&#39;re just condensed enough to combine to make one piece of energy or one particle... So the collide and push one another and this is why... We see vibrates <br><br>so they collide in the center and push away from the center of the electron and the center pieces pull the on the other little pieces that are traveling away from the collision in the center.....<br>And gravitational pull from the pieces in the center pulls the other little pieces that are being pushed away from center of the electron...<br> back towards the center of the electron because of the other little pieces in the center...... Good enough my name is Dylan ray Stone Okay so the field that makes up gravity is in all fields....<br>Accept space which is also its own field....<br>Or you could say time acts like a smoke and some pieces of the smoke are more condensed than others and whenever these close to the same condensity pieces collide they pull in on other fields and their own field creating a gravitational pull... Or it&#39;s another field inside the second field...<br>Doing the same thing as time and then basically one of those pieces becomes condensed enough it pulls on the second field.<br>Then the first field also pulls on its  little uncondensed pieces to create what we call gravitational pull😂",0

Fix the relationship with Mexico&quot;. &quot;Please&quot; they need us don&#39;t forget that. Do not trust Putin that ship is lost &quot;Just take it slow man&#39; work on one thing at a time&quot;. Remember Rome wasn&#39;t built in day. China lol don&#39;t sweat it. Just a reminder that business needs a facelift. Dishonest companies, an professions, scammers. People are hungry and do a lot of stuff to pay rent. It&#39;s not all about paying it&#39;s the position your stuck in have little&quot;choices&quot; .  Rent needs to be lowered, you can give gas to people it still wouldn&#39;t change much. We need to work on being honest, being kind and taking a swing at stuff. At the end of the day I&#39;m dying, I&#39;m wasting my time. If we wont create the job of are enemies, we are creating criminals and competitors.  Applications can be done after a interview. I&#39;ve have a whole lol jobs that, I can think &#39; to keep the economy, booming an people happy and busy. That is true success when you don&#39;t have any enemies and you learn from all your mistakes. Your never alone in this world somebody&#39;s is always there. If you can just fix the issue in Mexico it would change the gap that was opened.

A developed country they said!!!!<sep>Finally some common sense. Thank You Prime Minister.<sep>Maybe we could also ban mrurder. Yet another stupid policy.<sep>Whilst you’re at it how about banning knives in public and class A drugs? Oh…for us adults that have quit smoking  (millions in fact)and switched to vaping I can see when labour get elected they ban flavours to  “protect children’ and then ban vaping all together as is happening in Australia and America. I actually support banning disposables as they get chucked away but mark my words this is the start of my adult rights and choices being eroded …<sep>Yes Rishi, I hate the Youths vaping and i feel ashamed to be in the same generation as them.<sep>Amazing guy<sep>NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. a question for the priminister and the genral public?

-yEJnYJ5Mh8,President Donald J. Trump Visits New York City Bodega Victimized By Soros-Funded D.A. Alvin Bragg,"Today, President Trump visited the New York City bodega where Jose Alba, a New York bodega clerk, was robbed, attacked, and, ultimately, wrongfully accused of murder after being forced to defend his life. President Trump’s visit to one of New York City’s bodegas comes at a time when retail theft is skyrocketing and the New York City police force is on track to fall to its lowest numbers since the 1990s by 2025. Bodegas are a lifeline to underserved communities, and President Trump believes that only by undoing the Democrat party’s soft-on-crime policies can law and order be fully restored to every borough throughout New York City.donaldjtrump.com",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yEJnYJ5Mh8,"He told that reporter she was nice and doing a good job.

My uncle John du Bois grandson of sir Louis du bois de Fiennes the first family of the u.s. in 1600 the new paltz patentee of NEW YORK THE FOUNDER OF THE U.S.  did major cases in the Supreme Court holding all menu rights. This is unrealistic. Our family&#39;s been robbed and robbed. We&#39;re the French family that built the United States of America, where the French family had died for United States of America.  We have a New York that robbed us the new Pat Patten teas all the land 40000 acres. We paid for from the Indians and the Indians fought with us to build this country. What&#39;s happening is very disgusting. I&#39;m realistic. We have 2 presidents running and they&#39;remely unfit. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with American today. If they&#39;re messed up with the cell phones.  They&#39;re ever looking reality, but we need to come and stick up for our country. People need to get in the streets. People need to start running for Presidents and people need to start trying to make this country better. This is a great country. We made the world better. We have made each country better. We have made the whole world.  Become a better world. We have presidents and governments that are ripping. Everything apart all foundations. This is happening in one way. French, can the England england came over here? Baltimore and the Catholic Church came over here. Both of land hospitals, we have not seen nothing yethe Catholic Church to holly running Catholic Church had but been buying up all the hospitals Trinity healthcare. We have a capital health that is from Canada. Canada has free insurance, but they&#39;re over here.  Making money off our government with the capital health from Canada. And we&#39;re making way in the billions and trillions of dollars of Americans. There&#39;s so much false stuff happening in our country. It&#39;s on real logic. There&#39;s no way we should be sending our taxpayers. Money over the kill women, children and men. It&#39;s our taxpayers money. I really do believe that 1 taxpayer. Would it okay their tax money going to murder children?  Women and men destroy families destroy countries destroyed destroy destroy. I don&#39;t believe the poor the middle class men families would have paid this at all. We have disgusting presidents right now. We have a lot of disgusting people and government. And they&#39;re not just ripping off. The people of America to destroy the world what we built into a beautiful world.  With less money, we&#39;re destroying it. We have women going in the stores. Taking her paychecks hoping oh. There&#39;s a lit ladder machine at let me. I hope I win. Maybe I can help my children more. Our governments have become gamblers. Drug dealers and f*<b>***</b> liars. They&#39;re just f*<b>***</b> liars. They&#39;re misleading the people. They&#39;re misleading the good hard-working people of America.

Lavrov king<sep>These people like Linda Thomas Greenfield can&#39;t hang with the Russians.   Russians not messing around and US likes playing too many games.<sep>❗There should be an URGENT lining up of countries that are willing to: GROUP A 1. cut off all diplomatic &amp; economic relations with USA, UK and Israel, 2. Keep to themselves and have NOTHING EVER to do with USA, UK and Israel. GROUP B those that are not willing to do that. Those can do all the warmongering among themselves and be the topics of various news networks and subjects of spins and lies, and must completely ignore GROUP A and keep GROUP A&#39;s names out of their f**ing mouth. ❗<sep>I&#39;M WONDER, WHY SERGEY LAVROV WAS NOT INVITED TO THE OVAL OFFICE?<sep>Brought by Pfizer media is most trusted media.

Show US, UN and their so called mates, when they invaded in Syria, Iraq, Libya and now doing in Palestine, why this cock suckers shut their mouth in that situation and why human rights not worked in there. US started all this only to loot their assets as we all know. USA and EU start this war between Russia and Ukraine, main reason is Arm&#39;s business and put sanctions against Russia.

Can someone help? Thanks<sep>The last of the intelligent presidents.<sep>maybe the downfall of this man was supposed to keep us from listening.<sep>For some reason, these clips of President Nixon have hit my YouTube algorithm  and I am enjoying them. Nixon had his flaws but his foreign policies and global views were fortuitous.<sep>Biden united China with Russia and most of the world against us. Don&#39;t need this money grabbing criminal  failing at every policies he touched.<sep>Where can i find the full speach?<sep>Is it bias or not as I think the older generations seem a lot smarter than people today. Maybe back there was more time to read  books 😂<sep>At those times the world wasn&#39;t civilised<sep>Affffh<sep>They were going to be ...Until President trump ended it<sep>As opposed to what we have today.<br><br>How far we&#39;ve fallen.<sep>And that is from president, who resigned because of a tape on a door...<sep>HE made China a super-power by opening a trade agreement with their slave labor!<br>Reagan solidified China&#39;s future by legalizing Out-sourcing! <br><br>Two Presidents, one great big fuck-up.<br><br>.<sep>People who are defending Russia are clowns. There is probably a reason that we are aligned against Russia. And it is not because they are the only good guys...<sep>Says the terrorist war criminal pig 😂😂😂😂<sep>Smart man.<sep>Only haters , fear. China is 4x bigger. Of course it will grow and surpass the u.s.  is that what your afraid of?? India and China will grow! Like it or not.<sep>And, ... the CHINESE can WALK to RUSSIA!!!  They need planes and ships to reach Taïwan!!<br>😉😉😉😉😂😂😂😂<sep>Not Russia... America has everything to worry about 🇨🇳 China<sep>❤❤❤<sep>THIS GUY RECOGNIZED CHINA FIRST .HENRY KISSINGER THE NATZI   GAVE NIXON ALL HIS TALKING POINTS......MEN WHO KILL<br>THEY HAVE NO OTHER SKILLS!!<sep>No prob US was so Dumb in their foreign policy they made real strong alliance between China and Russia<sep>If you want to represent Nixon&#39;s legacy, just put up photos of unflushed toilets😂<sep>💤💤💤😃<sep>looks like a crook to me.<sep>This man was a crook, and crooked Russia is using his words to influence Americans who are ignorant of history.<sep>Why do it always seem that back in the days our leaders were more intelligent than today?<sep>Instead its US worried abut anyone having even the slightest difference of viewpoint compared to themselves....<sep>Nixon fell for the false Russia-China split. Just like many do today.<sep>Wow America once had visionary leadership! Ooh America what happened to you??<sep>China has become a threat in the 21st Century, but not for Russia, but for the West.<sep>He pushed China to capitalism, and now China rivals the US.<sep>whose idea in the US was it to give china technology and mve there US industry and capital. ?<sep>Its a little weird that the nixon foundation is attaching propaganda in most of its videos titles at all, considering its a librarian/archivest organization......<br><br>Not to mention the fact that the title of this particular video is factually wrong when applying this specific quote...<br><br>Still weird im hearing propaganda come from this source.... i wonder how Nixon would feel about it... probably point out how the &quot;imperial media&quot; has gotten out of hand dont you suppose?<sep>Thanks for that Nixon. You have waken them. Doesnt look good<sep>Everyone talks shit about him because of watergate. Watergate was this man bugging the government to protect the people of America from our government. Hillary Clinton was part of the subject of his bugging the house. Long before Bill was a concern<sep>Wrong china north Korea Russia are not inferior in any way<sep>People don&#39;t realize the d€€p st@te got rid of him.<sep>And Indians think they can win war against china<sep>So far everything he has come to pass.😮😮😢<sep>Nixon was the man, unjustly vilified and forced out. His &quot; crime&quot; pales in comparison to Obama&#39;s, biden&#39;s and Hillary Clinton&#39;s crimes. The only recent president to be on a par with Nixon as a competent, capable president is Reagan<sep>Nixon at his best,<sep>His watergate scandal is nothing compared to what the swamp does now a days<sep>Nixon went to China.<sep>😊Amazing!!!<sep>The American government wanted war from the start.they talk about Iran Proxys.while they have proxys all over the world fighting for them against their rivalry nations.israel is 1 of them<sep>Not sure why this CHina vs Russia narrative being parroted since the early 2000s. It wasn&#39;t realistic back then and it sure isn&#39;t now. China shares a lot of commonalities with the Soviet Union and Russia, heck CHina practically copied the Soviet system and military. <br>Surely its nice to hope that Russia would have to deal with China and America will have less to worry about, but lets be real, China and Russia will not go against each other until America is defeated.<sep>I believe you&#39;re the one that awaken the Giant, Nixon.<sep>What is this crap. Russian propaganda being spewed by Americans?<sep>So prophetic!<sep>McCarthy and Nixon were both correct.<sep>I&#39;m Canadian. I had a dream 30 years ago that we were invaded.<sep>only the U.S how to worry now<sep>He was correct on every point.<sep>back when leaders of nations were skilled with geopolitics and wisdom, today we have conmen and snake oil salesmen becoming presidents<sep>Now that what i call a prophecy.<sep>Oh.. the good ol days<sep>Damn.. my whole life Nixon was kinda made fun of... this is super wise!<sep>You are obses whit the Russia &#39;dear&#39; USA 😂😂😂<sep>One of the best president ever sadly Jimmy carter got his place the same like joe biden<sep>I miss when our president could actually speak naturally<sep>Now the same thing is happening to china in its own backdoor! New giant is awakening with most of the world against china<sep>A REAL STATESMAN. HE KNOWS THE WORLD SITUATIONS. UNLIKE MOST OF THE POLITICIANS. INTELLIGENTS VITAL.<sep>America is sleeping now and dreaming to get Russia back from China. There is a monster China to whom Russia belongs.<sep>No notes, no teleprompter, no que cards and no hesitation. Just pure brilliance. Nixon now more than ever!!!<sep>One thing wrong they are not enemies but allies! Their goal to bring down the US ruled based order and replace it with a multi-polar one.<br>The west has had its day, a new world leader is emerging.<sep>History and current escapades by the DNC to create more political prisoners sure makes Nixon look like a genius in comparison.  Uh, spying on your opposition? YEAH, we been seeing a LOT of that by Biden&#39;s FBI, CIA, ATF.  Nixon&#39;s efforts look like child&#39;s play now.<sep>Totally wrong in todays world<sep>This is why I always liked President Nixon  ( Nixon knew what  he was doing and what was going on ) and what he said almost seems prophetic with what&#39;s happening today<sep>Nixon knew that VP Johnson had JFK killed.<sep>He’s just a Freemason not a prophet<sep>Every coming US president must watch this clip.<sep>how did we go from this to hair sniffing corn pop senile joe????<sep>Tricky Dicky was right about that....<sep>O/10 for world prediction<sep>To all praising Nixon and his &quot;,prophetic words&quot; just remember he took the dollar off the gold standard and its because of his mistskes that the dollar is now a fiat currency and has lost 95% of its purchasing power since 1972<sep>Superpower is not a threat. It’s the CCP.<sep>He was in touch with reality, and could see what may happen in the future a very intelligent person.<sep>Nixon was paranoid, vindictive, cruel, and corrupt, but he wasn&#39;t stupid<sep>Nixon nailed it! And what he was impeached for is the equivalent of stealing a candy bar from a convenience store compared to the shit politicians get away with today. Sad really if you think about it.<sep>The more I learn about Napoleon the more I&#39;m impressed every time.<sep>Biggest Navy in the world now!<sep>He resigned for less than Hillary Clinton was given a pass for.<sep>Nixon is being honest. Talking of the fact that Russia has to be concerned about its neighbours....Russia only entered Ukraine because the US wants Ukraine to join NATO and is planning to install nuclear missile bases straight along the Ukraine Russian border. It&#39;s not Russia that wants this conflict. They have little choice. <br><br>The irony is that Nixon was a brilliant President who had to resign over...frankly, nothing.<sep>What I don&#39;t understand is why a Super Power nation would be a threat? <br>These wars are only Ego, nothing else 🤦🏾‍♂️<br>I can&#39;t believe we let these crooks run the world<sep>You people really think these clowns write their own speeches.<sep>Imagine the degradation of the Republican Party, from Nixon to Trump<sep>This man is completely dumb, saying China will lead the world and during his regime investing heavily on China and developing its economy so what does he want to prove?<br>The greatest mistake he did to think that China will get overwhelmed by American investments China to be just like other American allies and see today.<sep>luckily for the world that the us has no more such capable and wise president<sep>Nixon was a deranged and easily manipulated CIA asset. Look into the lengths the CIA went to try and misinformation the public about Nixon.<br><br>The CIA even founded, funded and supported foreign agencies like the &#39;Unification Church&#39; to make Korea and other countries influence elections towards Nixon and the Bushes.<sep>The ‘Deep State’ could not allow President Nixon to remain in office because he knew and believed the ‘Word of God’ and was brought up with a praying mother.  <br>Bible eschatology describes, in detail, the coming global anti-Christ, ‘Antichrist’, ‘One New World Globalist Cabal System’ and he was not a ‘globalist’.  Heaven is described with beautiful gates and walls, Hell is described with gates and walls but no bottom.  Adam chose to rebel against YAHWEH’s clear instruction not to eat from the ‘Tree of the Knowledge of Good and and Evil.  He chose his beautiful wife over his Creator.  Only one tree was withheld from him as a test of his faithfulness.  The Serpent beguiled Eve and was seduced, the thought of loosing a wife, created from his rib was too much to resist Lucifer’s deception.  Sin entered a perfect world and Adam lost the ‘Birthright’ to all that God created.  Adam and Eve died Spiritually that very day but physically died more than 900 years later.  Adam, not Eve passed on their new ‘sin nature’ through the fathers from that day forward.  Blood of an unblemished clean animal to cover their sin was then required from that day forward, “without the shedding of blood, there remains no remission of sin”,  YAHWEH provided The “Once, for all” shedding of His ‘only begotten Son’s perfect blood for an eternal blotting out of sin for all who would simply believe and accept in their heart God’s free Gift of LIFE.  I made that wonderful choice on June 27, 1960 @ 7:30pm, West Coast Time.  God no longer sees my sin but the blood that was placed on my heart at that very moment until my physical death.  Ephesians 2:8&amp;9(KJV) and Revelation 3:20 explain the simplicity of bridging the gap between sinful man and our Loving Creator.<sep>The good old days when politicians were actually intellectually competent",0

How do you do that?<sep>Our costs have definitely gone down.  Inflation started in November 2 years ago.  And nothing has gone down or gone back nor will it ever except fuel, but it’s still incredibly too expensive. The economy came back so quickly because you shut the whole world down. If you forgot about your dictator ship in terms of closing, everything down and dictating that people get vaccinations and wear masks and if you don’t call that a dictator ship, I don’t know what you call it.<sep>When you was running for president, you would have a rally of like twenty people, donald trump would have rallies with tens of thousands of people you stole the election<sep>bro u started it😂<sep>Rofl &quot;lower your costs not your wages&quot;. Wow, Joe always has to prove that people can be dumber than I thought. I guess this will be like gas... it will double and then drop 3 cents and Joe will take credit for 3 cents cheaper but ignore that it is still 99% more.<sep>Nothing has changed. Inflation is ridiculous, the poor are getting poorer, and the rich wealthy are getting even more wealthier. Biden stop lying to the people.<sep>🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤣🤣🤣🍑🍑🍑🍑🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🍑🍑🍑🍑🤣<sep>Just stopped by to see what the comments are like and I must say I’m very pleased<sep>Step 1: print money.

That&#39;s ocd.<sep>Biden stinks!!!   I don&#39;t believe inflation is getting any better. Restaurants and super markets still taking advantage of consumers.  Biden has NOT made anything better, in fact I see things such as the cost of medical insurance is WORSE!  An egg sandwich costs $ in north NJ. $7.00, and the cost of eggs has gone down...but no relief for consumer~!!   .  Order chicken parmesan takeout and it&#39;s $23.00!   GEEZ IT&quot;S CHICKEN!!   Biden and Harris STINK!!!   They still say it&#39;s &quot;supply chains&quot; &amp; that is BS!  Even McDonalds is $20.00 for a dang Big Mac.  And the housing in north NJ is so outrageous, rents running 2,000-3,000.00 for a 1 bedroom and starter homes are untouchable at 500,000.00, if you&#39;re lucky and don&#39;t get outbid by 100 people! !   Biden you will never be re-elected.  Harris is so USELESS &amp; so is Bettagieg!   And I&#39;m no Trumper,  but things are going downhill and fast here in North NJ!<sep>Wow…a bunch of lowlifes who support Trump. And here, I thought I was useless<sep>We Wanna Air Force Of Navy<sep>We Wanna Navy Of Air Force<sep>Well let’s just put it this way. You know that you raised it.

La nature il n&#39;en a rien à foutre, ce qui compte se sont les euros, plein d&#39;euros .<sep>Comment croire à un e telle hypocrisie ? Macron et son gouvernement est la pire chose qui pouvait arriver à la biodiversité. Blablabla comme tout le reste ! mensonges !!! la biodiversité pour Jupiter c&#39;est d&#39;autoriser le massacre de milliers d&#39;oiseaux protégés par l &#39;UE pour plaire à ses amis chasseurs. Pour Macron la biodiversité c&#39;est d&#39;abord le fric , pour le reste on verra çà plus tard toujours après les élections. Mais les électeurs ne sont pas tous des soumis et des chasseurs et se souviendront du mal fait à la nature par le roi Macron 1er, Glyphosate , permis de chasse, tuerie autorisée, CETA etc etc . Le roi des menteurs !<sep>Très bien M Macron, mais que fait -on avec le MERCOSUR? ha oui cela n est pas de votre compétence, mais celui de la commission européenne! des mots encore des mots;mais il y aura toujours des crétins pour trouver cela formidable.<sep>Y’a papa Noël derrière toi<sep>Жду ответ Уважаемый президент<sep>Уважаемый президент в скажи чтобы они мне набрал меня к слову виза отдал Вот мой номер вот третий раз отказ это что не шутка это<sep>Merci pour la mine d&#39;or en amérique du sud pour Bayer pour la production de voitures essence ou diesel au choix... pour les tonne de tabac de mégots et surtout de l&#39;enfouissement des déchets nucléaires étrangers sur nôtre territoire pour de l&#39;argent public qui servira au européens et aux.... en 2 ans, tellement!!

Pardon ?<sep>J&#39;ai l&#39;impression qu&#39;il y&#39;a que les gamins qui aimes macron et qui se laisse influencé par ces discours (au-lieu d&#39;agir). Pas vous ?<sep>« Que d’hommes se pressent vers la lumière non pas pour voir mieux, mais pour mieux briller » (Frederik Nietzche)<sep>Organiser des équipe volontaire pour replanter des haies sur les bords des champs ... Inciter les constructeurs à laisser des espaces sauvages et à utiliser des matériaux favorables à la biodiversité (pierre, brique, ...) ... former les agriculteurs au bio et réorienter les aides vers le bio ... faire des commandes d&#39;Etats pour le bio dans les cantines scolaires ... faire des campagnes de masse pour dimunuer la viande ... remettre les chasseurs à leur place ... faire des lois réellement protectrices pour les animaux sauvages ... repenser la condition animale ... etc ... etc ... Macron ne fait que des mesurettes, le reste du temps, il philosophe. Pathétique !<sep>Supprimez déjà les produits chimiques!!! De nombreuses maladies endocriniennes sont dues aux produits que vos partenaires financiers aux européennes répandent. Stop à la destruction de la biodiversité aujourd&#39;hui pas demain! Vos discours c&#39;est de la poudre de perlimpinpin!<sep>Avec le nombre de mécontents, l&#39;on est en droit de se demander si les sondages pour les européennes sont fiables. Si le comptage des manifestants est vue à la baisse, pourquoi tous ne s&#39;accorderaient-ils pas pour qu&#39;à l&#39;inverse, les sondages mettent en tête Larem et le RN afin de nous refaire le coup de 2017 ? Assistons-nous à un second braquage ? Perso, je doute que le RN soit si haut, leur partisans ont vu l&#39;amateurisme de leur présidente lors du second débat, cherchant ses notes, rejetant ensuite la faute sur Phillipot, refusant de démissionner, bref Larem VS RN c&#39;est un jeu de dupe dans le seul but de nous influencer, Mélenchon est bien plus haut qu&#39;on le croit et cette fausse guéguerre sert juste à le faire redescendre.<sep>Les Francais sont menaces de disparition <br>Marine sauve nous<sep>On en est où avec ce bateau qui a coulé dans l&#39;océan avec toute sa cargaison de produits<br>toxiques ?<br>On nous a parlé de marée noire sur nos côtes, puis silence radio sur ces deux sujets ?<sep>Я вот граждан Россия вот не могу ваш страна попасть в 3 раза не отказ поставил визу посольство Франция город Москве так чтобы получать может письма какой-то отправить чтобы я получил ваше страна посмотрел<sep>Здравствуйте ещё раз уважаем<sep>Здравствуйте уважаем президент Франции я хотел ваше страна посмотреть но Ваше посольство визовый центр город Москве или отказ поставил 3 раз я гражданин с как чтобы я получил ваше страна поехать посмотреть<sep>Mais tout cela, nous le savons déjà et le pratiquons aussi.

Vous parlez de réduire le gaspillage mais l&#39;agriculture biologique gaspille énormément. Pour éviter de vous contredire et de tuer l&#39;agriculture française, une solution serait l&#39;agriculture de précision qui utilise de nouvelles technologies pour cibler les plantes en besoin. Cette technique permet de réduire l&#39;utilisation de pesticides (et le gaspillage d&#39;eau) sans pour autant diminuer la productivité des terres agricoles.  Il faut aller de l&#39;avant pas régresser vers des pratiques du passé (comme le bio). ça n&#39;est pas durable.<sep>Comment voter pour vous quand vous avez dans votre liste un pro-polueur, non surtout pas votre liste, le en même temps ne fonctionne plus Monsieur, et on ne vous écoute plus.<sep>On dirait un exposé de collégien 🙏😘<br>C’est choupinou.<sep>Merci pour votre discours<sep>Vous êtes là les gilets jaunes !!!! ? :)",0

But in any case, China will not be able to provide aid to Iran because the risks to China are too great. We cannot deny that Iran&#39;s leadership in the Islamic Revolutionary Army poses a threat to democratic governance under the world&#39;s most important principle of sovereign security. As Iran has always declared, the Islamic Revolutionary Army is a ready enemy of the Zionist system. Therefore, all countries that pose a threat to the democratic system of governance under the world&#39;s most important principle of sovereignty the new world governance system must be revolutionized to protect human security forever. Because there is little sovereignty stability in the geopolitics of the Middle East compared to geopolitics in other regions, the United States must revolutionize the government with a new democracy, and I believe that the establishment of Israel as the leading geopolitical power in the Middle East will can reduce the geopolitical power of Iran and Russia, thus ensuring that we will not lose the war under any circumstances. 👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆<sep>God protect and bless Israel 🙏❤ 🇮🇱<sep>Vientos Minister Netanyahu 👉👍 Fuertes Hermanos Hebreos 🇮🇱💯 Los Apoyamos Siempre En Oraciónes 💖<sep>Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸<sep>מה שכתוב בדפי הכתוב איש לא יכול או יעצור, יהוה יאחד את עמו וישיב את כל הארץ שנתן לישראל הוא עצמו ישקם את מלכותו לפניו כל הברכיים ישתחוו ויזעקו לרחמים מזעם יהוה אותו דחו<sep>המלכתה את ביידן לראש הממשלה החדש של ישראל,את ההחלטות ביידן קובע.את הדלק לא נכניס לעזה חלילה,אבל מסיסות לא נכונות בשקרים הכנסתה טונות של דלק וטונות של מזון.אתה ממשיך לחזק את חמאס.<sep>Can you translate English pleas this is youtube platform it should be english translate it&#39;s still not ower Owen channel it&#39;s YouTube not ours<sep>אני מקווה שביבי קורא הודעות, לדעתי החטופים שנרצחו בשבי זה בידיים שלך ושל גורמי הצבא  שלמרות המחדל ממשיכים בתפקידם כמו כלום לא קרה בושה למדינה שמתנהלת כך.אם הייתה עושה מצור בעזה מהתחלה ללא רעשי רקע יש מצב שהחטופים היו משתחררים מזמן,ללא מים וחשמל ובטח לא דלק חוץ מדיבורים אתה כלום.<sep>עוד הצהרה נבובה מפי השקרן בן שקרן<sep>jews in skibidi toilet<sep>אבל עוד לא נצחנו בעזה.<sep>אבל עוד לא נצחנו בעזה.<sep>אבל עוד לא נצחנו בעזה.<sep>אבל עוד לא נצחנו בעזה.<sep>God bless 🇮🇱<sep>Isrealsuppotters.

GGRlnaBIeVc,Macron 'Confident' France Will Beat Argentina in World Cup Final,"President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday praised the French football team, after it defeated Morocco to reach the World Cup final in Qatar.France beat Morocco 2-0 to reach the World Cup final against Argentina, in a historic match between the defending champion and Africa’s first ever semifinalist.When asked if he was scared of Argentina's captain Lionel Messi, Macron cheekily said he preferred the Paris Saint-Germain forward when he played in the French capital.""He's a great player when he plays in Paris, but I prefer him in Paris than on his national team,"" the French president said with a smile.Macron added that the French had a lot of ""respect"" for their final adversary but that he believed his Les Bleus were ""well prepared"".""I am very confident in this chemistry and I think this is a team with a lot of willingness, generosity and it will have 68 million people backing them,"" he said.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmSubscribe to our newest channel Quicktake Explained: https://bit.ly/3iERrupBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

Still haven’t subscribed to Self on YouTube? ►►  http://bit.ly/selfyoutubesubABOUT SELFDaily health, fitness, beauty, style advice, and videos for women who want to achieve their personal best in life. Francia Raisa Explains How She Became Selena Gomez's Kidney Donor | Body Stories | SELF",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBb4X5Hb6k,"I was on the waiting list for 7 years while I did Hemodialysis. I went with a deceased donor and refuse to take my children’s because I didn’t know how and if it would be  traumatic for them. I had a tough recovery and I would not wish that on anyone. My donor is my hero that I never met and I am beyond grateful.<sep>Selena is so toxic and so evil. The only one worst than her might be Taylor.<sep>Justin Bieber hates manipulative drama queen.<sep>i might donate my kidney to someone thank you for this video<sep>this is so heartbreaking..🥺💔💔<sep>Just like she jumped up and got a permanent tattoo for a relationship she did the same permanent decision for a relationship that ended, honestly it sounds like she was forced. Don’t like how this all sounds , seems coerced, sad<sep>So lie google it Selena did not force her she was willing to donate wat lie and fake news they grew a part because of her mind and me documentary so lie get your facts straight<sep>i didn’t know Selena’s bestfriend is sooo pretty. Way prettier than her.<sep>I just don&#39;t understand one thing...couldn&#39;t a millionaire like Selena get a kidney by some unknown person...i mean there are donors who could sell their kidney for whopping amount of money....<sep>The only people I’ll give a kidney for. Is my Family<sep>This girl is insanely beautiful in and out ❤<sep>But the body is tea<sep>You have to show them all over the place, you donate an organ, you don’t complain about it……. How much money did you get… spill it<sep>How can yall still “stan” this woman after watching this video just baffles me <br>This girl was straight up manipulated by EVERYONE including your fav to give out her healthy kidney, she wasn’t even given time to think !! <br>This is horrible <br>And the fact that she was treated horribly afterwards as well<br>Sickened to my stomach truly <br>I hope she recovers and lives a healthy life without giving mind to all these limitations she has to live with just because she was pressured to give her organ to someone selfish<sep>She is beautiful then Selena gomez&#39;s<sep>Am an indian... what is &#39;namaste moment&#39; ???<sep>Selana could’ve helped her in anyway, like a job as a high position for her own name etc… its so sad<sep>Ok so I loved Selena my whole life ... But I hate her for this the way she treated her after getting the kidney... I mean Selena should worship the ground francia walk on .... Hate hate hate hate for Selena<sep>Taylor Swift would never give Selena Gomez a kidney. The fact that Selena would allow this relationship to have such a break is ungrateful and shameful.<sep>I would have backed out. Especially for the way she was cornered. It is unfair.<sep>i wuda never given a friend my kidney - like idc who it is or how famous. this girl def regretting her decision<sep>Love ❤<sep>and if she would&#39;ve said NO people are gonna think she&#39;s the bad guy.<br>when it&#39;s her RIGHTS?<sep>Everything aside what did she say <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBb4X5Hb6k&amp;t=219"">3:39</a> namaste moment?!? that makes absolutely no sense at all😭😂<sep>They trapped her into donation.. wtf<sep>This kid had to literally sell her kidney to get anything mentionable in showbiz. Maybe she was crying because she knew how fickle it was. If she had to milk the kidney transplant then you know things are tough.<sep>I hope she at least got a lot of money so that she can have a great life and financial possibility to care for her family.<sep>I relate with not being ashamed of the scars, not wanting to get them “corrected”. The scars we wear tell our stories, and I love to tell my stories and hear others’ stories.<sep>YA&#39;LL KEEP CREATING NARRATIVES. YA&#39;LL DONT KNOW THESE PEOPLE!! Francia LITERALLY was interviewed at an event for Selena recently, and she said that the break in their friendship had NOTHING to do with the kidney and that she regrets nothing.<sep>Poor girl got manipulated<sep>i have three csection scars... the numbness never goes away... i had complications during my second surgery and lost too much blood my temp dipped dangerously low idk what they did... i would never give one of my organs to a famous person. selena while she faced complications... never should have treayed francia that way... she literally gave her the organ to sustain her life... it was wrong of her to act that way.<sep>Is it worth it to be friends with wealthy and powerful people? They will just use you - they don’t know how to treat people decently.<sep>She is so gorgeous<sep>Not me watching this in 2024 thinking it just happened in 2023 till I saw the time it was posted on YT saying 6yrs ago... Now I can say am not really into celebrities life stories and stuffs<sep>What a beautiful soul ❤<sep>I get the impression that Francia cares about Selena way more than Selena cares about Francia. Selena is enamored with Taylor Swift, who is already “best friends “ with everybody in the modeling and pop industry. I hope Francia has friends who care about her as much as she cares about them<sep>Selena used her<sep>And one of the reason i stop admire &amp; lost my respect for Selena Gomez..Francia deserve better ❤<sep>In selena&#39;s narccistic mind she probably credits herself for Francea&#39;s entire career smh<sep>I asked my mom’s anonymous donor to be my maid of honor and now she’s my best friend<sep>🙏 ❤🙏💚<sep>I genuinely hate Selena because of how she treated Francia<sep>I wouldn&#39;t donate my saliva to that selfish egocentric called friend<sep>She had alot of pressure on her to get tested<sep>I never liked Selena... never was and never will.<sep>Why would they cut the middle of her abdomen to reach a kidney in the middle back  🤔<sep>Crazy theory but I think Selena knew Francia was her match already before the test! That’s why Selena became her friend just to get her kidney. There was no doctor inform Selena first, she just called her because she already knew!<sep>first time i seen comments regarding the bad approach of selenagomez rather than praising her whatever she does. People are too empathetic to her.  But I feel totally emathetic to this beautiful women who sacrifices for her friend. ♥️<sep>Francia shouldnt have done this.<sep>Britney is onto something with her bitter taste towards Selena<sep>This girl was manipulated by selena<sep>She seems sweet<sep>Is not about being a fan of one of them is about how they choose to make their friendship going<br>They all have their own life no need to be taking her where ever she goes or wrote or even lived like a trophy<br>They are OK with how they are relating now is no one else business<sep>Makes me wonder if Selena bribed the Dr if there was a match to be told ahead of her friend so it would make it more difficult to be turned down 🤷🏻‍♀️<sep>“Ohh why am I crying“ 😊 she’s so cute<sep>how come Selena gained weight and Francia is perfect with her body...and Selena always blaming medication for her weight even now....a long time has passed...how come Selena still gaining weight<sep>Poor girl idk what happened to take that decision, but for Selena I don’t see anything about related to be best friends.<sep>If she refused to give her kidney, Selena’s entire fan base will be after her<sep>Herro ❤<sep>What’s the name of the doctor? That doctor really needs to learn some ethics of the medical profession<sep>I have seen the other interview were Francia was sad Later Selena didn&#39;t even mention about her much she just told Taylor is my one and only celebrity friend<sep>This woman is a gem and I’m so happy she is bringing awareness of her struggles and speaking her truth. <br>Selena is ungrateful and so disrespectful to call her “someone she knows”.  It’s ugly truly. <br>If “someone I know” gave me a part of them to survive I would forever give her credit for being where I am.<sep>The very least Selena could do is pay for the laser off tattoo, &amp; be very appreciative towards Francia for providing  her another chance for life. ❤️<sep>Seriously  selena is not what she shows..that victim card won 👏👏<sep>She should not have offered if she wasn&#39;t sure. Coz when she offered selena felt hope and maybe pestered the doctors to know about.<br>I am not a selena fan bdw<sep>Oki but why she is telling us this?<sep>The whole situation was shown as a great sign of friendship and something that should have been supported like it’s a movie scene … movies show a part of life but do not show what’s happening after it’s done missing a lot of detail using basic emotions … someone has got a kidney but someone has lost it, what after ? Someone has cut off a piece of your body and that’s normal? I know someone who had it done and now he needs to take pills for the rest of his life after giving away his kidney plus might end up with some diseases specifically caused by this … life is not a fu….ing movie where you get rewarded with eternal friendship and happiness… don’t give away yourself so easily because it could be not worth it. Discus it with your actual family on how it potentially could effect them before believing in something like friendship<sep>Selena&#39;s trauma is facing death.  People who face that wants to bury anything that would remind them of that saddest phase in their lives.  I am sure when she is over that trauma, she can be normal again and extend a genuine olive branch to the woman who extended her life.  But in the end, it is the Lord who giveth and the Lord who taketh away.  Blessed are those who give.<sep>I am wondering if Taylor Swift was tested too 🤨<sep>Screw  Selena.  Finding out first was a complete breach of ethics and it happened because she’s a ‘celebrity’<br>Gross abuse of privilege.  Not allowing Francia a chance to understand the procedure and the ramifications.   <br>Appalling.<sep>I would be very curious to know her perspective now on the whole situation<sep>Bonita por fuera y dentro ! ❤<sep>Why did she gave a test, if she’s not ready or 100% willing to give her kidney?? Anyone??<sep>She need to be compensated very generously ...so it would be even between the friendship....trully...she give her half life...<sep>That&#39;s awful<sep>This is amazing.  I hope Francia inspires others to be living donors to people.  Whether or not she regrets it or whether or not they are friends what she did was a priceless gift.<sep>I repect people so mich for donating<br>Personally i would be so scared to go through the operation<sep>how beautiful soul look like*<sep>poor girl, it was really a hard decision! if I was Francia I didn&#39;t do that for Selena! because she hadn&#39;t spoken to her for 6 years!<sep>Selena should give her the half of everything what she has<sep>Thank you for donating your kidney. We need more organ donors. Giving someone a second chance at life is the best feeling. Godbless all those who have donated and who are planning one day to donate. ❤🙏<sep>I almost feel like Selena pushed her to do this. Francia was under so much pressure. The fact that the doctor decided to tell Selena first that Francia was a match, and Selena called Francia to tell her &quot;We are a match!&quot;. Of course Francia felt pressured!<br>Plus, everyone around them&#39;s priority was to save Selena, so I am sure that she felt like she had to do it. <br><br>And Selena just ended up saying that Taylor Swift is her best friend, like wtf. You have a friend that sacrificed an organ for you and you literally owe your life to that sacrifice, and you are not loyal to that friend? That&#39;s why I am so scared to have friends lol.<br><br>Selena is so full of herself and she always plays the victim.<sep>absolutely horrific!<sep>Andres a fighter<sep>wow..<sep>It is a HIPAA violation to inform someone other than the one being tested that they are a match. Especially the recipient herself. That was SO wrong. They took away her chance to choose for herself and think it over. And then Selena makes that comment that Taylor Swift is her only friend in the industry? Wow. And she didn’t even apologize. Donating one of your organs is no joke. What an ungrateful friend<sep>I have supercharged kidneys but i never saw a supercharged girl like you that donates a serious part. You are brave and humanity then some other on these days.

GOD BLESS AMERICA AND DONALD TRUMP. Say Bye-bye to BIDEN in 6 more months.<sep>Putin said it, Biden is a puppet...<sep>He has a very sense of humor in his face and voice that can hide it.<sep>putin call out zilinski or vice versa and get this thing settkeled win or lose whiever wins. it dont have to be fighting it can be anything you agree on to settle save the men and do it like gs<sep>Samuel is best for Putin .<sep>Story : hum log ? Harami ? The ? Sath me drinks ? Lete? The abhi ? Biden ? Sayana ? Ban gaya ? Hai 😢.<sep>O presidente Putin é o melhor do mundo,inteligente, honesto, tem bom caráter e sabe cuidar, muito bem do seu país. 👏👏👍<sep>Yes, of course  putin  likes the weak president  we have.<sep>😂😂😂😂😉😉😉😉<sep>Of course he likes Biden lol...hes about 900 and can&#39;t find his slippers<sep>Putin Knows That Trump Is An inexperienced leader! That Is So Sad! If Putin Could He Would Vote Trump In Office Himself 😂<sep>Dictatorship, This Putin Wants To Advance His Country With His Partner In Crime Trump! What A Corrupt Team!<sep>I bet he changed his mind on this when the current sanctions were implemented.<sep>Because it&#39;s easy to control Biden&#39;s strings that are tangled.<sep>What he really mean is that Biden is so old and senile that he wont pose any kind of threats to Putins war.<sep>Joe Biden the follower, just doing whatever is popular. We don&#39;t need followers we need a leader... USA USA USA 🇺🇸 🌎<sep>FJB! IS WHAT HE SAID,  MAKE NO MISTAKES 😂<sep>Lol you guys are saying Exactly what he wants you to think. Obviously he would prefer trump, because Trump likes to parrot everything he says and takes money from Putin. Biden, the guy who has done nothing to support him and has actively spoken out against him, unlike Trump, who praises him and spreads his ideals amongst his followers. Isn&#39;t it weird that so many Trumpers are pro Russia at their rallies?? Why isn&#39;t this all common sense I really don&#39;t understand<sep>Funny how they block the words with a sign<sep>Putin  is using reverse sicolegy .meaning the opposite.<sep>Putin preferring in here Turnip over radish.<sep>Ça c.est un foutage de gueule...🎉❤❤❤❤bravo wlad.😂<sep>Basically you&#39;re scared of Trump and would never have invaded Ukraine.<sep>I&#39;m hearing  pregnasing muneee siblings na kinara tariff<sep>😂😂😂 gotta love Putin …. Biden is good for Russia and bad for America 😂 ❤<sep>Putin knows the signs of the times in the Old Testament.<sep>Who’s selling fossil fuel for a higher price?  Biden is delusional.  Struck off from God grace and union.  Zechariah 11-10,14.  Did violence to the law.  Hosea 4-4.  Should have never played God.  Extorting priests to traffic in the sheep for their unjust gain.  Zechariah 11-4.  Seen Tom MacDonald’s video, dirty money?<sep>of course when the cats away the mice play common sence folks do what they want ooooof course he prefers it<sep>I guarantee Putin likes Biden right where he is<sep>Lol have confidence in was the key word. Are there actually still Americans who can say with a straight face they still have confidence in Biden? And actually genuinely mean it? Seriously?<sep>Elections have consequences.<sep>Has this man altzheimer?<sep>Reverse psychology. B is a greater threat to Putin whereas T will side with him.<sep>Putin sees that Biden isn&#39;t good for America so he likes Biden.<sep>Esatto bravissimo presidente Putin 🇷🇺❤️🇮🇹<sep>I agree with Vladimir. Biden 2024, 2028, 2032…..<br><br>Make Vladimir happy<sep>People are saying that putin is waiting for Biden to make mistakes. But Biden supporters are thinking that Biden does not have to wait for putin to make mistakes - he&#39;s already made them 🤣. Thats why he helped conald get elected once - so conald could bail him out of some mistakes by helping slow millitary aid to Ukraine because putin is struggling desperately with his invasion 😂. But stupid is as stupid does, and putin lost his 2nd attempt to get conald in again, even with conald sending groups of false electors to 14 states, threatening pence to cheat, and even trying to stop the final election process at the capital on 1/6 🤦‍♂️. So, now putin wants Biden, lol? Even the maga commentors are laughing. Everyone knows putin is just just trying to look innocent in case Biden wins AGAIN and decides to pay to have Ukraine push into moscow. russian nukes are good but not if the invasion is near their federal capital, moscow.<sep>My tears are from the current president obiden.<sep>Everyone is laughing at us and I don&#39;t blame them.<sep>.more predictable hahahaha!!!!! Of course he is is.<sep>The Great<sep>Of course he does. He wants you to vote for Trump.<sep>He said that because he can control over him. Trump not going to take no mess from him<sep>You are very well dressed mister president extremely charming extremely irresistible extremely dangerous the ideal man cause all women adore the powerful intelligent successful strong and determinated men like you I wish all men were like you<sep>He loves giving it to Biden because polls are moving in Trump&#39;s direction.  But much as Trump pounds his chest, saying he is the hawk on defense he stood down to Putin. Biden hasn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t. Biden has also been committed to the defense of Taiwan.and has made it clear to China that their aggressions won&#39;t be tolerated. This election is going to be about foreign policy and who can lead us against Putin and China and Biden has the edge.<sep>Putler is a war criminal.<br>Greetings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱.<sep>Biden&#39;s a mouse compared to Trump who is a warrior,<sep>😂😂😂you must to understand that everything what putler say is opposite! If he says Biden is better it means that for him Trump is better!😉 He is a liar and this is his tactic😃.The history talks!<sep>Hahaha ! Great interview. 😂<sep>So trump is unpredictable thus none can play games with him right 😂😂<sep>Coming from a colonel of KGB, you should understand the opposite of what he is saying. 😂😂😂<sep>Reverse psychology<sep>Kameez<sep>Now, Going to sleep<sep>Wore the Salwar Ksmeez and attended the Ramzan Namaaz at Saleemnagar Idgah and gave them the 2nd Dark Pink Envelope<sep>Sorted Microsoft One Drive and Google Storage Accounts in the Morning<sep>🤣🤣🤣<sep>Putin sees him and Trump as useful idiots. Trump directly. Biden indirectly.<sep>He’s praying that trump wins the election so he literally can get the war over<sep>Looks like MSM needs to be alert to &quot;Russian interference&quot; again this election, but on behalf of Biden?",0

But the heavens🌌 and the earth,🌎 which now exist by the same word, are reserved as treasure, and are kept for fire,💥 until the day of judgment, and the perdition of ungodly men. 8 But do not be ignorant of this one thing, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, though some count slackness; but he is longsuffering toward us, not willing that some should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.<sep>I like how sofia has that natural &#39;plastic&#39; face<sep>I knew the exact sensation she was talking about when she explained cotton balls!<sep>Sofia always won<sep>I disagree with most of the people here, it can be clearly seen that Sofia is doing that accent purposefully, I am from India and I have never been to any western country and my mother language is hindi but still I can speak better than her, she is just doing drama up there<sep>Intentan, los norteamericanos, burlarse de Sofía porque tiene acento cuando habla en un idioma que no es el suyo???

Mucho machismo recalcitrante, sólo hay que ver las pelis americanas que reflejan una sociedad americana hipermachista.<sep>Shocking that Ellen can’t touch balls.

8vIMeyrj8SI,Pakistani Army is obsessed with India 🇮🇳 Mr.Riedel,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vIMeyrj8SI,"When is the last time your army won any wars? Your army and government is still obsessed with fighting despite losing every single war you&#39;ve started.<br>Some say it&#39;s not about winning, but about making profits at the cost of your sons and daughters<sep>Correction obsessed with hindus<sep>Since the British empire split it?<sep>And America supplies arms to Pakistan to create war with India.u white imposters<sep>State Sponsored terrorism <br>Pakistan isn&#39;t the only country<sep>You know, Russia really came through for us in &#39;71. We&#39;ll never forget that.<sep>It only goes to prove that they were emboldened by Congress governments in the past, who were incapable of dealing with them.<sep>Pakistan people doesn&#39;t hate India. Its the Pakistani politicians and military dictators who spread hate and hate propagandas as they kept losing.<sep>Yes this strategy is working<sep>Pakisthan is our brother v fight funnyly<sep>india is more obsessed with pakistan.<sep>What could possibly be causing their obseccesion?  Could it be religion?<sep>Israelis are very obsessed with Pakistan. Because it can give Nuclear technology to Iran.<sep>Who cares about his research<sep>India has been saying this for decades, but Western countries turn blind eye to this and exploit this situation for their own agenda. They even let China use Pak against India. Why is not anyone talking about how China is using Pak as its proxy by giving free weapons to fight with India.<sep>I wonder how much india paid him😂😂<sep>Excellent...<sep>Tea was fantastic 😅if u know u know<sep>A day without humiliation is a day  wasted<sep>India has always been the border that prevents the spread of the Muslim religion in that area. They have stood fast and repelled invasion after invasion. Saving millions from being forced into becoming Muslim and being brutalized.<sep>Dozens of my comments against the Indian narrative have been removed or are not being uploaded.  It seems that YouTube can&#39;t accept anything against popular Indian narratives especially anti-Pak.<sep>The attitude What India as a nation has of Pakistan today, the same did Prithviraj Chauhan have of Ghori. Prithviraj pardoned and allowed Ghori to return every time of the 17 times Ghori attacked Prithviraj. That was the mistake of Prithviraj Chauhan. India is in the same path of that of Prithviraj.<sep>i thought it was india that was obsessed with pakistan<sep>It will lose for ever<sep>Obsessed is a mild understatement to what Pakistan actually thinks regarding India. Pakistan believes in a Concept of Islam which says Ghazwa E Hind written in a Hadis which says the conquest or war against Hind or India, a situation where Islam will take over India and India would be ruled by Muslims and Hindus would either be killed or converted to Islam.<sep>All lies.<sep>Indian media and politician obsessed with Pakistan<sep>That&#39;s all that&#39;s there is to Pakistan in nutshell<sep>They said &#39;they will eat grass but will have nuclear bomb just bcoz india have it&#39;<sep>The greated army in the world which is yet to win a war!<sep>Another nation ruled by that religion of peace fastest growing nuclear arsenal. How peaceful is that?<sep>He is lying and I don’t believe this person.<sep>They convinced terrorism works until the Anonymous<sep>Pakistan is the jealous little sister of India.<sep>Rectify the economy of Pak first then talk about building nuclear and other things.<sep>Modi destroyed second strategy successfully and brutally 😂😂<sep>Who has been supporting Pakistan in all this ??  And,<br>What did Both Pakistan as well as its supporters achieved from it ??<sep>This coming from a Genocidal country,all the coups over the world,lost Vietnam and Afghanistan. This fool represents killers and usurper&#39;s of the third world resources. They lie and their presidents are mass murderers all because of the military industrial complex.<sep>Pakistan is beyond your micro imaginations and pea sized brain.Its a purpose based creation small crockery can&#39;t handle the truth n cang see the unseen yet.They will see only when the time comes<sep>That&#39;s why Azad Kashmir still exists<sep>No Pakistani is harmed in time Video as they are illiterate!<sep>Yeah that&#39;s a tactic that the Gen z er&#39;s Have done in America.What makes you think they won&#39;t try to do the same thing?There?It seems to work here<sep>Even cricket, it loses shamelessly, they win once in a blue moon<sep>Thats some pro Indian thoughts...which r cute but may not be accurate...as far as being obsessed.....i think and feel India is more obsessed with pakistan and always finding reasons to call pakistan out....just how i see it...nothing personal...<sep>The problem is every country has military and at Pakistan military has country and a stupid book.<sep>They gave this weapon to Pak. They are so called friends with india. weaponising india enemy. <br>Business as usual...<sep>Well paid India<sep>why<sep>Religious based war. Zero rational thought is possible. Such ignorance.<sep>Atleast now the 2nd theory wouldnt be working,they tried that but got surgical and air strikes,and if they didnt get the message try it again,they wont,till their is modi they wont be trying it<sep>Lol asymmetrical warfare is matching the enemy in areas critical to winning a war instead of matching him on every front. Example russia doesn&#39;t need a superior airforce because it&#39;s hypersonic missiles would neutralize enemy airfields which will naturally affect their combat operations. So overwhelming the air difference is enough to even the Plainfield of battle and allow your own forces room to breath.<sep>And the US will be idiots and support one of them instead of stay clear of it. 😂😂😂😂😂<sep>There ya go !!!<sep>What the fuck USA has been doing with Muslim countries Iraq,Syria,Libya &amp; Afghanistan ! The whole world has been facing a cosmetic anarchy created by the USA !<sep>India begging USA for help<sep>Pakistan will overtake India, soon actually!<br>IK<sep>Look at the u.s it did and worked well?? So what might go wrong with Pakistan?<sep>Pakistan Need to change mentality..if they need growth<sep>That&#39;s not right.. The army is not obsessed with India.. It is obsessed with holding power.. India is the only reason they have to exist and suck up such a high degree of their GDP..<sep>Pak Army is Pathetic, and this is not coming from anyone, I AM PAKISTANI. This Pak Military hasnt fully grasped that the real strength in pakistan is not your enriching your immediate family, but IT&#39;S THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN. Give them their manadated leader Prisoner 804, and you will see the most powerfulest country be born, with the mightiest military. But mandate MUST BELONG TO IT&#39;S PEOPLE NOT CURRUPTED BY ITS MILITARY. Dictatorships will not work but only seeks to destroy it&#39;s people and it will limit it&#39;s military&#39;s capability.<sep>And the US will make it worse just like everywhere else. Easy to talk about this and that, but then they make it worse.<sep>Right<sep>Bubby jio<sep>Pakistan over the last few decades has been overrun by muslims. The muslims want to conquer India they always have and they won&#39;t stop.<sep>Absolute bullshit stop occupying Kashmir and India can go about being a country not based on terrorism.<sep>Rightly said.<sep>Pakistani terrorism is funded by US 🤭<sep>Shame asim munir &amp; bajwa type Gernals.....real  Pakistan army 🪖 is Pakistani people.....<sep>Thank God for the partition. We have distanced from that terrorist nation. Jai Hind. 🇮🇳 ❤<sep>Says the modest American 😂 we know who you are America we expect nothing less from hypocrite 2 faced  American politicians<sep>And instead of helping India, no…! We are helping Pakistan! And we all know why they are obsessed with India.<sep>Both of these countries did not add anything positive to their people for being enemy to each other.<br>Peace is the BEST and only option!<br>Both people Will win!! Currently China and America is winning, not Indians or Pakistanise.<sep>Finally the world sees it<sep>Why are you fighting. Why your mind is dirty. All ways Talking about fighting<sep>These two countries must find a way for PEACE!!! That is the BEST OPTION both countries have!!<br>They should not listen America or China!! Just talk face to face!!<sep>West is talking now, till now they had dead rat struck in their mouth<sep>Now a days every western country shows their sympathy/respect with India but in past years they were always against India. These Western countries break the limit of hypocrisy. But anyway we Hindus believe that &quot;the whole world is one family&quot; that&#39;s why our Bharat try to help every country in their bad time. We are not like you all but we will never ever trust you blindly. Ram Ram 🙏🏻🇮🇳🕉️<sep>Feel sad for Pakistani public, but then again I dunno if there is truth in this quote, &#39;You deserve the leaders you elect&#39;.<sep>Sir, thank you for the Truth 🎉🎉🎉🎉<sep>indias biggest threat is not pakistan but 204 million Muslims living in India who feed on hindu tax payers money and support anti national activities.<sep>BHARAT beautiful lots of Humanity but Pakistan always terrorism destruction even killing ur own people<sep>The USA has often practiced asymmetric warfare in the past, and even today still. Ever heard of ISIS?<sep>A lot like America! Never winning a war!!<sep>US tried to turn the tide of war against India back in 1971 but USSR prevented <a href=""http://that.now/"">that.Now</a> you know why India ain&#39;t snitching on Russia today.<sep>American version of andbhakt?<sep>The US funds terrorism like Al-Qaeda, isis and Israel😂<sep>That’s the truth of Pakistani army , and they say Pakistan army is best !! But one thing i must say they best in begging.😅<sep>its a basic rule of nature....when you wish to destroy someone...whether you succeed or not doesn&#39;t matter....it will definitely lead to your own destruction .... pakistan is the prime example of this<sep>Thank the dumbest and laziest english surveyor who made that divide.<sep>Says an American. <br><br>Who lost the war in Vietnam. <br>Iraq.

0YKJ21BFn1g,How RFK Jr. has downplayed the Jan. 6 Capitol attack,"Over the past year, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for prosecuting Jan. 6 rioters, while suggesting censorship is a bigger threat to democracy. #rfk #rfkjr #robertfkennedyjr #jan6 #capitolattack #censor #censorship #independent #election #2024 #insurrection #pardon Read more: https://wapo.st/3PZ9USm.

Which is a crazy violent place where there is at least 1 stabbing a month<sep>Diese leute haben problem beim reden die brauchen ein Halsschmerzen Tabletten die reden das die voll verstopft ist mit einer suppe🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅<sep>Sounds totally reasonable--if they broke laws they&#39;ll go to jail. The main threat to democracy right now is the threat to free speech, but that doesn&#39;t mean some forms of election denial aren&#39;t also threats, or that he&#39;s &quot;downplaying&quot; those threats.<sep>Jan 6 was just a failed FBI false flag operation. All the instigators of Jan 6 in the FBI should be locked up.<sep>Destruction to property, i.e., is not free speech. Our constitution protects our right to PEACFULLY assemble. Rioting and assaulting are not forms of free speech.<sep>We will never forget.<br>We will never stop sharing free          Palestine.<br>We will never forget those Muslim    countries who are supporter of Israel, European, British and USA for genocide in Palestine. This genocide/ Holocaust of Palestine is done under the strict supervision of USA. This ammunitions/ weapons are provided by air cargo from USA. Americans and Israelis  pilot also hundred percent involved in Gaza bombardment<sep>the 60&#39;s got JFK, RFK, we get this nut<sep>Hard to believe his family havent stepped in to help interpret what he is saying. It sounds a little rehearsed but trying to fathom the guts of what he is talking about, is a little tiresome after listening to trumps mangled senten...ohhhhhgjitcnmfd<sep>LOL! Spare me the evangelical and bigoted views. There’s no difference between him and maga which is why they don’t bump heads. Bunch of ignorance and the sheeple on the right eat it up.<sep>This guy is a loser so much that his family does not support him, he sounds like he is dying with every sound he makes. He is a professional BS, (a person that is so convincing of his BS that he starts to believe as a reality)<sep>When a candidate is being attacked from both sides with both barrels, AND by the media, you know he&#39;s the one you should vote for. You really don&#39;t need to know anything more than that. Listen to Bobby on his channel or watch him in a long form interview/podcast. OR....keep voting red/blue and expect things to get better. NEWSFLASH! They will not. Let&#39;s go Bobby! RFK24<sep>Just the headline tells you how corrupt the media is downplays January 6th you broke the law you should go to jail<sep>RFK downplayed J6? more like the liberal media overplayed it to make it look worse than it actually was because their hatred of Donald Trump is unbridled<sep>what a POS, get a cough drop you sandpaper talking POS.<sep>Why is he always drunk when he&#39;s in front of the camera?<sep>rfk sucks but he&#39;s right here<sep>You lunatic lefties need to open your eyes to reality! They imprisoned people for having a peaceful protest on public land! And you are the fools who said the BLM riots were peaceful when they were lighting. Cities on fire! Get a life<sep>Get lost Kennedy<sep>God, every American should know who RFK Jr. is &amp; allow him to debate Trump &amp; Biden. He is the most presidential candidate we&#39;ve had in years &amp; has the common sense &amp; logic we desperately need as a country right now. It&#39;s sad that if you vote for him you&#39;re just wasting your vote.<sep>ITS TRUE!!!! Biden is the worst president in HISTORY!!!!<sep>Trash scumbag Washington Post. Screw you, you soulless bums. Get a real job.<sep>What are u doing? Just come out and campaign for Trump! Tell it like it is, cowboy.<sep>Downplayed?? 😂<br>He acknowledged facts.<br>The corrupt media has absolutely OVERplayed (overhyped) J6 for political benefit. People outside the media bubble see this clearly.<sep>So what I got from the video… don’t look at everything in black and white to judge whole groups of people? Ohh the humanity.<sep>Also the dems firebombed the Whitehouse in may the year before 1/6<sep>Go away",0

(Obama even mentions her name highly in a speech) also the democrats are trying to pass a law to allow late term abortions,I’ve even heard I think 🤔 in California if it’s true,that democrats are pushing a policy/law to be able to abort 28 days after delivery <br>Republicans are pro-life usually, I’ve even heard it said at speeches when a woman will ask about pro choice if the pregnant party was raped or the baby is A product of incest what were their opinions then on pro choice versus pro life be would it change and I’ve heard Republicans say why should the child be punished for the sins of the father ,that was very powerful to me, I truly believe that as well,if you don’t want to keep the baby then you give it up for adoption but don’t make them pay for their father’s sins not to mention if you don’t want to get pregnant it’s not rocket science there are so many options from the Depo Provera,to IUD’s,condoms, the birth control pill,the patch,the ring,the shot, a diaphragm,spermicides,,the arm implants,sterilization-tubal ligation or a vasectomy(not my personal favorites,unless you are sure you don’t want anymore children) The cervical cap, sponges, fertility awareness where you’re tracking your menstrual cycle the days in which you ovulate and are most likely to become pregnant coupled with your partner pulling out ahead of time!!!!!,and then there’s abstinence which is 100% effective!!!! oooo  so many options!!!!!👼🏼💕🕊… 👍🏻👶🏻… MAY GOD BLESS ANYONE READING THIS,republicans and democrats alike,may we all come together as one race,THE HUMAN RACE ❤<sep>Go trump!!!<sep>This is exactly the approach Trump should be taking.<sep>Nah cause why is this AI generated💀<sep>Dear rightful president.<br>God calls you in this time to work paralell with Netanyahu.

He did not.  Instead, he meekly walked through 8 years of  very bland leadership and then got a huge book paycheck.  His wife fancies herself a rival to Oprah and 2 kids that have accomplished nothing.  Now, he makes pronouncements that have very little impact,  It&#39;s been years and years of not much.  Nice looking guy, Great at speeches and awarding medals.  Incredibly wealthy guy and, at the end of the day, a real disappointment.  He could be so much more, as a black leader.

Man. I&#39;ve aged too.<sep>Before and during the presidency of George W. Bush, countries like China, Russia, and Iran feared and respected the United States of America because they knew who was in charge. From the days of President Barack Obama until today, the United States of America has forgotten about its balls, so countries like China, Russia, and Iran have decided that they can do anything and get nothing for it. In my subjective opinion, Barack Obama is the worst president in the history of the United States, because even the clinical idiot Donald Trump, who belongs in prison, has a character. P.S. The world is arranged very simply, you are either on top or on the bottom, and if you are in the middle, then you are fucked from both the bottom and the top at the same time Right now, the US is in the middle<br>P.S.<br>A spineless creature who in ten to twenty years will be recognized as the most insignificant president in the history of the United States<br>During his tenure, the war in Syria began, to which he turned a blind eye<br>During his term of office, a war broke out in Ukraine, to which he turned a blind eye<br>These two wars are still going on<br>These two wars have shown dictatorships like China, Russia and Iran that the Western world is weak and unwilling to fight and kill for its principles.<br>By the way, the war in the Gaza Strip is also a logical continuation of Russia&#39;s war in Syria and Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine<br>Vme is very simple:<br>The Western world will either die itself or wipe its ideological enemies off the face of the earth<sep>Burattino<sep>Sad he doesn&#39;t take credit for Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine since he did nothing to punition Russia in 2014.

That will probably be the last time this country will ever be that UNITED. That was the moment and squadoosh. Under Obama: nobody locked up from GFC. Lobbyists stuck around. Obamacare failed.

Companies that meet the threshold for size must either offer an affordable health insurance plan to these full-time employees or pay a penalty for not offering coverage. No company, regardless of size, is required by the federal government to subsidize health insurance for part-time employees who work fewer than 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month.&quot;<sep>No offense to Obama but he dropped the ball. He had the chance to make a statement that would have kept Russia at bay indefinitely. When the &quot;little green men&quot; marched into Crimea, Putin was testing the United States leadership&#39;s resolve as they always do. When Obama did nothing that was all the message Putin needed to invade Ukraine. When multiple members of Obama&#39;s cabinet told him he needed to do something then to make a statement, he did nothing and now thousands of innocent Ukrainian civilians and unwilling conscripted Russians are dead because of it. I&#39;m not saying the war is Obama&#39;s fault.

Americans died, and he couldn&#39;t help but check check his watch. He hasn&#39;t visited East Palestine. Still very much contaminated.  Hawaii is still needing help. He unsecured our borders and ignores the border states causing a nationwide migrant crisis. His administration rather sell supplies our tax dollars already paid for instead of finishing the sections of wall. Bideconomics is a disaster.

Is that progress?<sep>A new debate would be useless without a live fact checker and a mute switch on Trump<sep>As a Hispanic born to immigrant parents, Trump is the best choice I see. He only cares about doing the work. And as my father told me. &quot;A man&#39;s worth is that of their work.&quot; Trump gives me the best opportunity to fulfill my worth as a man. Trump or Bust for men idc about the legacy media. I care for action. Under Trump I saw lots or action  nothing under the racist Biden administration<sep>Yes trump is so racist, so much proof right here!!<sep>FJB<sep>Hey Joe.....I remember when your VP Kamala Harris told all of America that YOU were racist.<sep>ALL YOU Republikkkans speaking out the word poisonblood listen to HITLERS WORDS AND SEE HOW Similar they are to what Trump is speaking<sep>Well, it takes one to know one<sep>U ain&#39;t black if u don&#39;t vote for him<sep>“Poor kids are just as bright as white kids” - Joe Biden<sep>🤣<sep>Trump: &quot;I&#39;m not racist.&quot; Also trump: &quot;I cant see the the audience cause its so dark&quot; 💀 Ik he referred to no lighting but still<sep>Biden - Abraham Lincoln is the most racist HOLD IT 1 HES NOT RADIAT NUMBER 2 ABRAHAM LINCON?

The one who died because he ended slavery in the south?!😭😭😭<sep>FJB HES A RACIST    if you dont vote for him YOU AINT BLACK     yip those are his words<sep>I mean… come on. You know? Like ………. Come on.<sep>“The poor boys”<sep>Trump 2024 🇺🇸<sep>Oh wow im convinced<sep>Seek help soon. Please.<sep>Trump loves all people. He wants a secure border. Whats wrong with that?<sep>It&#39;s backwards world so what he meant was biden is the most racist president ever. And his words prove it. You have to take trump out of context to find makeup racism.<sep>Joe 2024<sep>Joey don&#39;t look like this anymore nor sound like this. I think he died and this is a double. Fjb!<sep>Fjb! I think joey diedb<sep>A vote for Biden is a vote to end the human species.<sep>Joe Bidens cognitive decline is nothing more than Devine justice<sep>Biden was a childish disaster<sep>A few years later the border is insecure and this idiot thinks he is president<sep>No, Trump hates black people. He just hates poor people more.<sep>Trump is definitely the most racist president in history. By Far.<sep>Immigrant kids are just as smart as white kids~ grandpa Biden<sep>Blind blind blind Let’s go Brandon!!!!<sep>He just called Donald Trump Abraham Lincoln<sep>Bro talking about abaraham licon banning muslims mean while he&#39;s booming  muslims.<sep>FJB<sep>This guy is a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.<sep>Apparently not liking Muslims (a religion) is racism.<sep>Literally imagine the people defending Biden when he has been the most racist president in our generation.<sep>Wow that Joe is a big racist<sep>I wonder if he bathe before the debates.<sep>How is trump racist when he employ’s black people and hispanic people<sep>Abraham Lincoln?? Biden really deflecting from topic<sep>Joe Biden supported segregation in 1977!!!<sep>To say most racist, is Joe the bar of what a racist is?<sep>Biden why am I subscribed to you<sep>This is the top result for &quot;times when trump was racist&quot;, this is the top result? seriously? Maybe it was all fake news then.<sep>When did trump ban Muslims from entering the country? He safeguarded the American people by not allowing people with links to terrorist organizations enter this country and having a better screening process to enter. Just because a lot of those terrorists happened to be Muslim does not make it a Muslim ban. Fake news at its finest.<sep>You didn’t say Trump, you said Abraham Lincoln. You’re just showing people that you can’t talk.<sep>Its kind of ironic Mexican is a nation not a race and muslim is a religion not a race, I wonder races he is talking about when he mentions both of those.<sep>Wait... we talking about lincoln here? Ir trump... now im confused 😂<sep>Abraham Lincoln? So if Joe has integral historical and reputational integrity, infact he is actually promoting Trump, by comparision to Lincoln? I only ask because I discover in 2021 the President of the United states was seen to convey, &quot;... Lincoln as a president who “reimagined America itself,” and one who “believed in the rescue, redemption and rededication of the union.” The phrase “better angels,” which Biden invoked, came from Lincoln’s first inaugural address.<br><br>“By fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed again just enough against our worse impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again now. They must prevail again now,” Biden said.<br><br>I have no angle here just laying out stuff found online...Let&#39;s agree that Trump has a somewhat outwardly racist vocabulary at times compared to those before him....Run some numbers on innocent civilians killed during presidential terms of all ethnciities and one begins to ignore the hype around the rhetoric and focus on that key differentiator...He&#39;s not going to be as up to date as many regards references to the disabled community either,  however statisically, by being less interested in the war machine and profitiring for its shareholders, disabilities by way of time served is reduced and there is more to go around for the Vets...<sep>If one were to take each man for his word, non withstanding any political biases, who is the most coherent in this clip?<sep>the &quot;Poor Boys&quot; 🤣<sep>thanks joe, you did it<sep>Biden Mexican and Muslim arent RACES<sep>Excellent! 😂😂😂<sep>All american r rasict🎉<sep>&quot;you aint black if you dont vote for me&quot;<sep>abraham lincon is the most racist man ever(talks about trump)<sep>“Chinese virus” not racist<sep>Search Trump Now that’s what I call Racist. Best CD. Of Trump racism.<sep>The poor boys 🤣<sep>Biden is more racist than Trump.<sep>Remember, this is coming from the person who said:<br>&quot;Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids&quot;<br>&quot;If you&#39;re having trouble whether you&#39;re for me or Trump, then you ain&#39;t black&quot;<br>And when referring to Obama, &quot;The first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean&quot;<br>We all know that if Trump said those things, he&#39;d be blasted by mainstream media for the rest of his life, but Biden? Nope, he gets away scot free!<sep>Right and biden is the youngest president ever<sep>One forgot his meds and the other can’t see colour<sep>Name one racist thing Trump has ever said or done, I&#39;ll wait while I watch a compilation of racist biden quotes.<sep>&quot;I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that&#39;s a storybook, man.&quot;<br><br>— Joe Biden<sep>😂😂😂😂<sep>TRUMP 2024<sep>Joe Biden is the most inept. But post just one racist thing ge said Joe<sep>I heard colored folks say they only voted for obama because hes black.<sep>Biden is s racist. Do your homework<sep>What!Lincoln is the best president then “Trump”.<sep>we wanted Biden when we hear what he talking... Now we need Donald Trump to fix everything...<sep>Imagine Joe compiling and editing this video<sep>The world when Trump says that maybe the leftist muslims should show us how to clean up their own countries: 😨😨😡😡<br>The whole world when Biden literally calls little black kids &quot;roaches&quot;: 😎😎💤💤😸<sep>India is killing people in America. Biden is a weak person and president. If Trump was at the helm of affairs. He would have banned Indian visas in the first instance. Stopped military exchanges and sale of arms.<sep>Biden lying makes trump racist? Big suprise idiots believe things without researching them<sep>Did he say Abraham Lincoln<sep>I’m not gonna lie trump isn’t telling the entire truth trump has ALOT of racist moments and he still is now he just doesn’t show it<sep>TRUMP WAS THE BEST PRESIDENT<sep>Trump is the most racist person ever!<sep>&quot;Poor kids are just as smart as white kids, I mean rich kids&quot; - Biden<sep>AND YET THERES NOT A SINGLE VIDEO OF TRUMP SAYING SOMETHING RACIST. BUT JOE BIDEN HAS ALMOST AN HOUR LONG VIDEO OF HIM SAYING RACIST STATEMENT AFTER RACIST STATEMENT. GTFOH 🤣🤣🤣",0

yK-e1Ywfx2I,Joe Biden's message for those who want to cut Social Security and Medicare,Follow Joe!Joe’s Twitter: https://twitter.com/joebidenJoe’s Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joebidenJoe’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joebiden#JoeBiden,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK-e1Ywfx2I,"FJB!!<br>🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP 2024🇺🇸🇺🇸<sep>Creepy Joe, you are our nightmare for a lot of other reasons. Both Medicare and Social Security are slated to go bankrupt in just a few years. Part of this is the ratio of payers to collectors and part of it is Congress borrowing from the Trust and never paying it back. Part of it is Barack Obummer stealing $500 million from the Trust to make Obummercare appear budget neutral. Creepy Joe continuing to kick the can down the road instead of reforming these two entitlement programs is yet another reason not to vote for a Democrat. Without reform, they go BANKRUPT. It is time to send the children to bed and put some adults in power.<sep>He is a shameless villain n doesnt respect his own ppl. His audience members always make it a point to laugh as loudly as possible n u can tell theyre paid actors<sep>MAKE TRUMP PRESIDENT!!<sep>Baaaaaaaaars !!!<sep>What a idiot, and those who believe him too. Throughout his career, he has tried to cut both. Why do you think he hasn&#39;t  mentioned it since being so call elected.<sep>Yes he is an nightmare<sep>Is that a terrorist?<sep>My dream is to see him gone January 2025 and to watch Donald Trump&#39;s second inauguration<sep>The reason the Social Security fund is bankrupt is because of DEMOCRAT BILL CLINTON. He raided $2 trillion out of the Social Security fund and transfer it to the government general fund from which it pays bills. This is how he &quot;balanced the budget&quot;. Put that $2 trillion back! We&#39;ve got money for every war and everything else?! That is not a government handout that is money that was EARNED by American taxpayers<sep>Very arrogant evil leader, your country were full of drug addicts &amp; homeless during your term.<sep>Child sniffer<sep>Nightmare on Pennsylvania Avenue.<sep>What an imbecile.<sep>So answer this one simple question republican or Democrat..... who do you work for?<sep>Why does he think Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare? He makes up things all the time.<sep>LGB FJB<sep>Why do democrats always have to say that Republicans want to cut social security when it&#39;s federal law. No one can<sep>He&#39;s the nightmare I can&#39;t seem to wake up from. 😢😢 maybe I&#39;ll sleep til November 😴<sep>More lies... shocker!<sep><b><i>&quot;I know that a lot of Republicans - their dream is to have free and fair elections. If that&#39;s your dream...&quot;</i></b><sep>He is a nightmare that part is correct<sep>Vote for biden! He treats everyone equally, and he makes social security and medicare possible for everyone! Biden is not a nightmare! Ultra Biden 2024!<sep>Criminal! FJB you are a nightmare!<sep>Nursing home👉<sep>Never heard Trump say he wanted to get rid of SS but this fake has. This POS would say anything to stay in power.<sep>Everybody’s GD nightmare!<sep>Vote Trump 2024<sep>Trump 2024<sep>Republicans don&#39;t want to cut social security or Medicare. He is a nightmare.<sep>Should have went with bush&#39;s plan where the money stays with  you<sep>Out of all the reels I seen about Biden this one is the best one lol<sep>❤️❤❤<sep>😎🥾🍊👑✌🇺🇲<sep>That is not true.<sep>just waiting for his obit.<sep>ZAR JOŠ PRIČAŠ??? MISLILI SMO DA SI ZATVORIO I OČI I USTA ZA SVA VREMENA ZLIKOVČE.<sep>You&#39;re EVERYONE&#39;S nightmare, possum boy!<sep>After reading he looked at us<sep>Republicans aren&#39;t the ones draining Social Security. Genocide Joe passed a bill giving Ukrainian Refugees 7 years of SSI benefits if they come here.<br>He also just proposed giving his 12 million Newcomers Social Security.<br>Neither group has paid a dime into OUR Social Security Trust Fund.<sep>That&#39;s his dream<sep>You&#39;re everyone&#39;s nightmare 😂<sep>If we want to talk about the economy and gas prices. In 2020 gas prices were so low due to nobody really traveling or just not very far, basic supply and demand. Today things are more expensive because of corporate greed flat out. Corporations operate to make money for shareholders, many of which are top company executives. Companies raised prices and others followed along sadly this has went on to effect practically everything in a grocery store as about 90% of the grocery store contains items produced by a small number of corporations. Other sectors are more expensive due to limmited supply, with not enough product coming out sadly prices go up. In the airline industry sadly this is becoming the case. airbus can’t make enough planes and I think we all know Boeing’s pretty extreme issues so airlines are searching for old aircraft to bring back into service which will increase the cost of these older jets. Biden is used as a scapegoat, yet in capitalist economy a president really doesn’t have that much control. Of course corporate executives blame Biden, he wants to tax them more.  What about the looming recession? Inflation is an excuse.<sep>How can someone not be competent to stand trial, but be competent to run a country?<sep>nah we need to cut Ukraine and spending for illegals.<sep>Like you can get ssi when you need it😅<br>Your a joke joey boy<sep>Dude is brain dead<sep>He&#39;s a gas lighter. Trump loves our senior citizens. He wont cut it. Effff JB<sep>Biden you lie like a rug  you will not cut S/S medicare<sep>He is dementic<sep>My dear Biden....please resign and bring up your grand children<sep>Biden, you’re a nightmare to everyone<sep>Joe biden 2024<sep>poops likes to sign 1.2 trillion pork bills<sep>Here’s to another four years🥂<sep>We all wish he was just a nightmare.  But we wake up every day and see what Joe Biden has done to this country, and it is nothing short of disaster.<sep>Nightmare Joe. New name to you. He does not say anything like this unless its stripted and comes to his ear plug/device. Dude is a plague. 😅<sep>You are no doubt a nightmare for the entire country and have been for a very long time<sep>Sounds like something Obama would say…<sep>Free Palestine<sep>can&#39;t right now. I&#39;m getting into investing...I&#39;m hoping to 1 day get as big A return on one crooked investment as Ukraine did<sep>About him:he said the n word<sep>😂😂😂He must not of remembered  when he said he want to cut the budget for social security  and medicare so what is he saying. OYEA I forgot he cant remember  that😂😂😂😂<sep>Another Joe Biden lie. He is a nightmare. The only thing he got right.<sep>lol this old man is really funny! But I truly believe his wife and whoever is working him should be charge with animal cruelty! I mean with you know the think against old people who are not mentally stable you know what I’m saying like in 1943 when I was you know where ! Anyway!<sep>Actually he is correct he was the nightmare of america😅😂<sep>No one lies like Biden<sep>You liar<sep>The dream is people to be able to be reliant on themselves. Not government especially when the government doesn&#39;t even know how much money it owes.<sep>He doesn&#39;t realize he been their nightmare sense day one he doesn&#39;t know what the heck he&#39;s doing<sep>Him trying to talk tough is funny. I saw a video where he was trying to cut SS, Medicare and the V.A.<sep>Bro All these texans are not understanding to dumb to understand what really goes on in the white house. Most people vote for trump cause they don’t get the right education and are usually poor or crazy. States like Texas and Oklahoma vote for trump cause people out there are farmer and live in rural areas that just want a crazy man to build walls and lower taxes. I feel bad for u trumpers for not understanding these simple things.<sep>No you&#39;re wrong I don&#39;t have nightmares unique souls only have beautiful gorgeous amazing dreams came through everyone&#39;s sick and it&#39;s up to me you want to be ready get ready Choco hey explain to the country how you call Latin woman you call Latin woman housekeeper you don&#39;t see your wife gace diamond Lou have the puppets laughing on you that&#39;s a simple puppets that&#39;s the only follow you popetst I don&#39;t have nightmares monsters Bohemian grovetown explain to the country what is that mean that town in San Francisco California what do you do that every twice a year once July what are you going there in your life twice a year why you go to this town explain the country what you do over there&#39;s<sep>I don&#39;t know why you still I don&#39;t know why you you don&#39;t have a right to defend yourself you put people inside the cage how you want to answer this justification excuse tell me why why why why why you don&#39;t close the border why the border is still open Mr choco Choco<sep>You go guy.<sep>Inflation cuts ss<sep>I hope he wins.<sep>Wouldn&#39;t need it if you didn&#39;t drain everyone&#39;s life😂😂😂<sep>Do not be deceived people<sep>When he can speek he is alright<sep>Reply to this comment vy saying Biden If You Support Him And Say Trump If You Support Him<sep>He’s a lying crook<sep>Vote Blue<sep>U r real nightmare !

Події в Крокус Сіті Хол та російське військове вторгення у вільний світ...<br><br> Московська мета викликати хвилі співчуття від вільного світу це не тільки,щоб виправдати атаку на Українські міста та села. Мета у московії набагато глибша та прорахована. Наче не усі росіяни погані коли знищують дітей та жінок та ще виготовляють для цього ракети. Насправді, що московити ненавидять усе і всіх і у всесвітній день води влучили у ДніпроГЕС. Тільки їх хворий розум знає для чого це:або затопити поверхню, або забруднити воду, або вивести з ладу ДніпроГЕС і створити посуху.<br> Не плутайте Християн, Мусульман, Католіків, Буддістів, Юдаїзм з терористами. Аллах(Аллаг) та Магомет не мають відношення до кремля і до терористичних угрупувань. Це той випадок коли під релігію маскуються амбіції, злі наміри, жага до влади і грошей.&quot;Ісламська Держава&quot; визнана терористичною і незаконною по усім стандартам 65 країнами. Який сенс цьому малопідконтрольному угрупуванню брати на себе відповідальність за стрілянину в росії? Повірте і перевірте діяльність москви раніше...москва хотіла боротися з вигаданими екстремістами пліч-о-пліч з Американцями, Британцями, Французами та Європейцями. Терористичні угрупування говорять словами кремля за гроші та за матеріальну будь-яку підтримку. <br> У москви наче номер не пройшов навіть звинувати Україну в крайньому випадку, але початкова мета була викликати хвилі співчуття від вільного світу та добитися таким чином приспущення прапорів на посольствах чи консульствах вільних та демократичних країн та щоб сказали в Європі та в Америці: &lt;росія це жертва терористів&gt; Зараз і у ці дні та клята росія знищує Українські військові частини, оборонні укріплення з великою кількістю Українських вояків, а не два чи три постраждалих.  Московія знищує великі мирні квартали у великих містах зі звичайними мирними громадянами видаючи це за знищення вигаданого ними іноземного військового контингенту, депортує дітей та жінок з захоплених нею територій та робить усі жахи минулих століть.  Знищення людей робить кремль далекобійними надпотужними протикорабельними ракетами та сотнями дронів-камікадзе. Кремль і є тим самим головним екстремістом, терористом та спонсором більшості війн та кібератак у вільному демократичному світі.<sep>Це стосується майбутнього.

Психічно хворих і небезпечно хворих треба лікувати та контролювати, а не давати їм владу захоплювати вільні країни, влаштовувати теракти вбиваючи при цьому власне населення та посилаючи їх вмирати в Україну, як це зробила та робить кремлівська влада.<br> Кордони держав бувають різні, але не обов&#39;язково більш округлі. Кордони це  емоції, спогади, мережа доріг і мостів, виняткова інфраструктура і т.д. Деякі кордони сучасних держав виглядають на картах досить дивно, але мало хто з лідерів хворіє на манію мати більш округлі форми кордонів. Мало хто в сучасному світі повторює російську федерацію з її неадекватною діяльністю.<sep>Every leader of every country should do what is absolutely best for their citizens. <br>I like Putin but I want what is best for America, and that is not Biden.<sep>Good Putin!!!! <br>PS: Visas for Canadians?<sep>E&#39; meglioseva&#39;in pensione<sep>The crazy thief is Biden and his family<sep>Biden may be weak but the American people are very strong<sep>Putin wants a new &quot;willing idiot&quot;.Not sure that&#39;s gonna happen.I&#39;m sure he&#39;s happy with the one he&#39;s got.IMO he&#39;s lying to help his buddy Trump election wise.Causing confusion has worked for Putin so far with the GOP.USA has been shut down for Russia&#39;s enemy  in Ukraine.Sad to see The US get played so bad by Russia.<sep>Putin is a small man! i<sep>That&#39;s Russian way to try and make us voters go against Biden, he&#39;s not going to tell you the truth lol<sep>very respectful men putin<sep>Unfortunately, Putin is identified as a dictator and after his brutal attack on innocent men, women and children, the video’s aftermath doesn’t paint a pretty picture of him.<sep>I’m not a fan of putin but at least vlad can remember his name compared to sleepy joe<sep>Biden Just got Humiliationnnnnnn!!!!!!<sep>Well said sir,<sep>Biden is weak and stupid.

HsbgFEO2pw0,President Biden Makes History with Anti-lynching Bill,"President Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law, officially making lynching a federal hate crime for the first time in American history.  #JoeBiden",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsbgFEO2pw0,"Better late than never, huh Joe?<sep>We would already have criminally prosecuted anyone committing the crime of lynching. I have no issue with this in theory, but lets not pretend that Biden is doing anything but managing optics with this stunt. He still violated our first Amendment rights by unconstitutionally censoring the people he claims to represent. He still sides with authoritarian medical tyrants on issues where &quot;the science&quot; does not support his authoritarian policies. He keeps our borders open and even lies about how serious of an issue it&#39;s becoming and also lies about his attempts to solve the problem altogether. He claims voting for him is protecting democracy despite refusing to debate political opponents and even goes as far as to censor them.<br>Biden will claim he has done amazing things for this country even as he burns it down with his own hands. He&#39;ll act like he solved something by making obsolete problems more officially illegal, while at the same time sending our tax dollars over seas to fund the military expansion and arms manufacturing for wars that we should have nothing to do with in the first place.<sep>Joe has my vote again in 2024.<sep>thats it vote blue all the way<sep>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Biden me &amp; my family went through something it&#39;s important i speak to you! &quot;Baytown tx&quot; has the same type of history you spoke of but with the Hispanic &amp; black community but mainly Hispanics only!<sep>I understand President Biden made it illegal to lynch since January 6th riots when everybody wanted to hang pence ,but can we keep it just in case  for someone who deserves it<br>The U.S. didn&#39;t hesitate to hang Suddam Hussein<sep>More Pandering.<sep>Fort.

TRUMPS  RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH , REGARDLESS OF GAG ORDERS , CENSORSHIP BY YOU TUBE FEMBOTS , AND ALL OTHER DELIBERATE IDEOLOGICALLY BASED MISREPRESENTATIONS BY THE SO-CALLED FREE SPEECH MEDIA..<sep>Ya Allah, may You give Donald Trump presidency again! Aameen 🤲<sep>❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Tell them to make a study on the mental disorders of children belonging to mother&#39;s who&#39;ve never been on birth control, and who&#39;ve been off the pill for at least 10 years, 5 years, and 1 year before they had the children.... And ask what their history is with abortions, and miscarriages.  <br><br>For so long the age of the mother didn&#39;t matter... history is filled with women who&#39;ve had children free of disorders into their 40&#39;s....  and I still don&#39;t think it matters when determining if the child will be free of disorders.<sep>LOSER! You Can&#39;t Fix Stupid But The Hats Sure Make It Easy To Identify Them!<sep>It’s all the s*** food that’s being fed and advertised to Americans<sep>I love when trump says he understands a topic better than anybody else<sep>I hope the hood realizes what it did voting for Obama and Biden it&#39;s your fault you fools<sep>End the reign of the big pharma, and the big bad Food And Drug Administration<sep>One more reason for one of the biggest corporations in America to pay big money to keep Trump out .<sep>All above<sep>VACCINES…. !!! He is telling you that he’s gonna expose the truth, about the bio weapons they have been injecting into the children for years now.<sep>I&#39;ve been trying for years  to have my voice  heard on these concerns. He is right 💯😢. This is exactly why he is fighting with everything he has. No other President has went through all the indictments. Humiliation, death threat&#39;s,loss  money<br> The pharma is about money. No resolution, .no mental health communication professional without hidden agenda. Horrible<br>All these children that have been assaulted crossing boarder being trafficking. They don&#39;t need to be on drugs forgotten about. They need healing.<sep>It&#39;s the FDA, and vaccines.<sep>This is close to my heart I’m 43 I had two children in my 20s perfectly healthy ! After my last child I had at 36 yrs old my baby was born with a genetic disorder that affects his organs kidney, and heart and was born with a COA which causes his large vein that pumps blood into the heart to be to narrow! He has multiple cysts that destroyed one kidney and only has one functional kidney. He has had several heart surgeries as well as open heart! We had every test ran including a leading geneticist study and do testing from Washington and she found a chromosome breakdown of his 8th chromosome which is very confusing for a lay person and my question is after ruling out family history as neither his father or me or my family have this disorder or genetic problem. My first guess would be it’s the electronics, they have lied to us I think and I know several other mothers the same year that had children born with these anomalies and something just isn’t right! They bury the research because they don’t want us to know that the 5G ect is breaking up and changing our DNA and I am convinced of this after reading into it and researching it! My first thought is the data is there as I seen and big tech and big pharma are making sure with their billions in profits that we don’t find out about this! I hope Trump wins and looks into all of this! It seems as tho everyone even Trump is on board with this 5G roll out however so my question is to Trump, are you not aware? And will you look into the research on this?<sep>These AGENDA47 videos are fantastic!  Keep them coming! Godspeed, President Trump!<sep>Big Pharma is in BIG trouble 🤧<sep>The food fax 💯<sep>Yeah 😌<sep>It has been said over and over again that there is a cure for one of the most feared illness and that is cancer and I for one truly believe it.  A nurse once told me there was cure for cancer but she was told to keep quiet as the discovery could cause a mass economic crash.  She told me they are treating cancer the same for the last 50 years.  She went on to say, &quot;What is wrong with this picture, just follow the money.&quot;<sep>This is what a President looks like and speaks like. FJB he is not my President. They stole the election and stole our futures<sep>so why didn’t you do anything about this when you met with RFK Jr when you were sitting president? instead you took money from bill gates to sweep it under the rug. why do you care now? would you keep caring or talking about this if another big money donor comes your way to shut you up again? hmm. fool me once, not again.<sep>Vaccine<sep>We need you back as president, keep up the great work! 24&#39;!<sep>今日もありがとう御座います。😃🙏<sep>Yes sir, why are our children dying of cancer ? It wouldn’t have anything to do with the ridiculous amount of childhood vaccines, now would it? I want you for president, and I want RFK Jr as your consultant on vaccines.<sep>I think this is linked to all the vaccinations children have to take<sep>Nice to meet u 😁😁😊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Amir Hossain nice to meet u<sep>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>President Trump, you truly are an amazing being and the most dedicated patriot I’ve witnessed in my lifetime. 🫡 🇺🇸When you say you are going to do something, you honor your word. ~ Attention We The People: We need to continue praying everyday for Donald Trump. Prayer in numbers is powerful and works miracles. 🙏<sep>God Blesse You Présidant Trump  2024 !!!❤<sep>NO MORE BIG PHARMA AND GO FOOD!!<sep>Ask, Sir.<sep>T  Y ❣️❣️🙏✝️♥️♥️♥️❣️❣️❣️<sep>All of the above including the VAKKS you love so much!<sep>Trump/Kennedy &#39;24<sep>God bless and protect you and yours.<sep>Trump vc está convidado a toma um café em minha casa! Um abraço de Samuel do Brazil.<sep>TRUMPS OWN MOTHER HATED HIM<sep>Nazi F. D. A. hard at work Screwing US !!!<sep>Diet, lack of sunlight, lack of activity and lack of social interactions.  Put down the donuts and hit the gym.<sep>GMO foods should be OUTLAWED. They should not be even used as animal feed. They are POISON.<sep>The demoncrats are destroying the children every single second that goes by. Right now the demoncrats are abusing children All over the world<sep>This is what a real POTUS does the Democrats have spent their time trying to destroy him and Americans and meanwhile Trump has been figuring out how to fix what damage they&#39;re doing.<sep>maga 2024<sep>It&#39;s in the food and water.<sep>Is it the thing you warp speeded and its ilk? Why didn’t you throw them into your list of suspects?<sep>I would rather vote for any other fascist from history<sep>Never seen such a passionate president. He is America..<sep>Trump 2024 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸<sep>Merci DT 👍❤️💯😍<sep>is this moron going to address these issues the way he addressed the pandemic and dismissed the worlds leading authority when it came to vaccinations and masks? so much BS his toilet has no room to flush documents<sep>Thisssssssssss!! Health is wealth<sep>What about the children killed by assault weapons? Where is the leader that will do something about this<sep>So if Walt goes to prison will trump have to hire a new nanny and  chief diaper changer, or will they both occupy the same cell?<sep>Why not start a charity for children opps you already did that<sep>Omg YES!!!! Thank you please do this, I’m voting for you <br>❤<sep>Puttu Sarwar Ali Khan ki biwi Najma Khanam Ke bare me sabhi ko bola tha marne ke liye mtlb tha Saif khan amit Kumar Tunna baki koi bat nhi hai<sep>Puttu Sarwar Ali Khan ki biwi Najma Khanam ko Jama Khan ko bola marne ke liye mtlb tha Bairgania Sitamarhi Bihar ka Saif khan se Puttu Sarwar Ali Khan ki biwi Najma Khanam patti hai setting ki hui hai Sexual Relation me hai Saif khan amit Kumar Tunna se jura hai amit Kumar Tunna se julsa julus me paisa manga yo bola two thousand de diye hai<sep>Imagine falling for a side.<br><br>They&#39;re on the same team.<sep>The American diet is shit.<br>Every county in every state should be growing food for the people of that county. Imagine the price of food from fully self sufficient counties. Imagine the job opportunities it would create. Imagine the quality difference of local produce, local meat, local anything in comparison to the foreign products that are marked at $10+ in every store right now. Imagine this, people!<br>I think taking out big businesses (like Walmart) and replacing stores of that ilk with locally owned and operated businesses would be such a win win for this country. If every county would become self sufficient in supplying food I think there would be a decrease in produce recalls, people settling for low quality processed garbage, etc.<br><br>Food is the BEST medicine. Big pharma products don&#39;t heal us or aide our immunity. Real whole foods full of life work with our bodies, not against them.<sep>big pharma does this on purpose with vaccines….. <br><br>it’s so obvious people<sep>Are you kidding me? Our universities have been on this forever--we have huge health problems which aren&#39;t solved by Trump acknowledging we have health problems. Just like his failed health care. This has little to do with pharma. Try a proper diet.<sep>And this is why Too many special interest institutions are furiously after Our President Trump because they know Trump will put them in jail Killary get ready<sep>4yrs isn&#39;t long enough.  Our constitution is solid, but it allows for these crazy swings in literally everything.  4yrs until infinity.  Heavy weight champ until he gets beat ..<sep>THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP! School choice allowed all of my kids to attend a $9000/quarter private school that manages autistic children! ALL of my kids are autistic and I’m not the only family this has happened too!<sep>No ty to you or any of the crazy Republican officials being in the White .<sep>Crush Biden ! Enemy of the people.<sep>Shots and food.<br>Change my mind.<sep>Only Donnald Tramp ❤😊😊😊😊<sep>Mr President I whole heartedly agree with you but in terms of our children and the older youth, this extreme indoctrination and brainwashing that is happening at the highest level since you were cheated out of office in our schools, College&#39;s and Universities is our of hand and has put our future in a downward spiral. The pendulum is swinging towards a side where there might not be a substantial recovery for a couple of generations!<sep>I Have Hope And Faith That We Will Win It All Back. Time To Have Hope And Faith In Trump And His People And The Republican Government And The Republicans And Real Christian People. It&#39;s Time To Bring The Original Laws, The Original Constitution, And The Original Holy Bible Back To It&#39;s Purest Form Of Life.<sep>🇺🇸 Down with trump!🇺🇸<sep>Wow, yes!<sep>YES MR President!!<sep>Very good<sep>O presidente que reconhece Israel como nação Glória a Deus 🙏🙌<sep>&quot;Then I will ask them&quot; Who? big pharma, or your Blue Ribbon Committee?<sep>Tucker thinks RFK is the only one concerned with this.

Short and sweet. Separate. No hugging . It’s fake. Teaches obey mom. No serious respect for truth.<sep>They hit and fight because of their terrible parenting. I hope you&#39;re done having kids<sep>Müthiş bir anne<sep>Great parenting she&#39;s a solid mom. I&#39;m not sure big boy&#39;s on board.  there&#39;s always contention in the siblingssphere but this is a good start 😊😂<sep>I don’t think how she talks to the kids is wrong per se, but they are boys pushing and hitting each other is not the end of the world you need to keep it under control more than not beating the crap out of each other, but a little bit of it is going to help with real life<sep>Do you understand? Yes...<br><br>1 minute later: Round 2, FIGHT!<sep>What a great mom! ❤<sep>Boys fight each other sometimes; I dont think it is appropriate to oppress it so much.<sep>So creepy they record everything<sep>sie sind  SO SWEET SO CUTE!<sep>Where is your husband?<sep>I don&#39;t want.<br>I want to him be clear.😅<br>That&#39;s all.<sep>So sweet from this mom and these cute boys<sep>I love this! ❤<sep>&quot;...and always make sure the camera is rolling because it doesn&#39;t count if nobody&#39;s watching. Do you understand? Okay now go record your brother being cute and monetize your relationship.&quot;  The amount of damage you&#39;re doing to your children by staging these interactions is concerning.<sep>Well boys will be boys<sep>awww<sep>😱😨😳😖<sep>Both need to be corrected.  Time outs and talk doesn&#39;t always work. My brother was always abusive. My mother let him pin me down and tickle me till I cried and peed my pants. Horrible parenting.  This allowed  abuse led to worse abuse.<sep>Proper parenting when they are young, and teaching them love with proper discipline is so crucial for their future! Great example here, I love this so much!<sep>But off camera I bet she be yelling and taking that switch out!<sep>❤<sep>Good mom for sure even though I’d probably buy boxing gloves 👍<sep>Killing human nature in the purest form. End of the man is near😢<sep>Those videos are cute and all but it feels wrong that these kids are being recorded for thousands of strangers to see. Might be better to at least don&#39;t show their faces<sep>All i see is hundreds of videos of this woman telling these kids the same thing. This doesnt seem to be working because the videos just keep coming and its always the same thing 😂😂😂😂<sep>She has got to be exhausted at the end of the day doing all this emotional support, caring and correcting redirecting my goodness😂 I mean I support it but I know how tiring that can be!!!<sep>give them boxing gloves.. they&#39;re boys<sep>U just teaching the smallest one to be a cry baby like Yh he small but u gon sugar coat it’s and give him a big ol hug it’s cool now but he keep on doing it when he stars to get old the gon start being a brat I saw it happen wi my peoples kids the smallest one start making up stuff and blaming they siblings and them getting in trouble as run and run to her mom like a crybaby hugging while her brothers in trouble the n the othe siblings get tired of it start hating there little siblings and hating their parents cause not enough attention<sep>I need a baby mama like you good job mis<sep>I can&#39;t help but wonder if giving them so much attention, not to mention making them camera stars, when discipline is doled out will lead them to act out in order to receive that attention/discipline.  Discipline should be somewhat unpleasant.<sep>You should act like a mother and stop filming yourself.<sep>lol I do exactly this and my boys still pound on each other<sep>They are taking absolutely no notice as there’s so many of the same videos ! 🤣🤣<sep>Should she need a third son I&#39;m a candidate😊<sep>I always see the same behaviour of this children and your methods... looks like it doesnt work<sep>I want a wife like her 😢<sep>❤❤❤<sep>Amazing words and you are like an angel that fell from heaven❤❤<sep>Good job Mom!<sep>Discipline childrens for them to know what is good and bad is very important and that&#39;s the main purpose of parenting but from ur videos I felt personally u gone too far the relationship between siblings became like more of mechanical, boundaries so it lack color like we used to have. I think interference should be limited.<sep>Yes Mum<sep>Whatta good mama!<sep>Demonstrate conflict resolution with dolls<sep>So am I the ONLY person asking himself, &quot;Where is their father?&quot;<sep>fights between kids is good, it develops their self confidence - but ofc there are boundaries as to not physically hit each other<sep>ur big boy have little atitude issue. ❤ but its looking cute.❤<sep>Those boys will grow up to love and support each other.  Truly wonderful way to correct behavior.<sep>You&#39;re 100% definitely not supposed to say look at me. You&#39;re not to force eye contact,  but yet you do.<sep>Mom has a great mindset! 👍😉<sep>They have no incentive to comply. They willfully disobey and you keep talking. You  will raise dishonest, manipulative monsters<sep>❤❤❤😊🎉<sep>Werty<sep>Also - at the end - ask clarifying questions: --  What do you do if you want something your brother has?   What is one thing you should not do to your brother?  What&#39;s one more thing?  Is fighting a good way to get what you want?  What&#39;s a better way?<sep>That&#39;s me and our dearest Nshi, 5 year old now. She fights with everyone threatening to slap the grandma. I speak to her like an adult and ask her firmly and to follow the rules. Now, they said I am the only one she listens to and revere in the house.<sep>OMG you&#39;re really kingda mom,that is very important for childrends teachin them love<sep>The bestest mum<sep>When I was in pre-school, I used to fight with my best friend ALOT. The teachers sometimes had no choice but to put us in another classroom alone, and we sat the edge of the rug away from each other, but still facing each other. And honestly it always worked because we end up talking and playing after like 2 minutes. And I feel like I&#39;d love to use this method as a time out for when my future children fight<sep>I love how the bigger kid really squeezes his baby bro he knows what&#39;s up this is creating the best bond ever I sure wish we had someone like you in our family of 5 that aren&#39;t close and don&#39;t apologize it&#39;s great seeing better than I had<sep>That was a really aggressive hug 😂<sep>❤❤❤❤❤ Hi dear you are a amazing talent Mom your children are very very sweet and cute i love child i like you so much do you want to see me are you okay lovely dear ❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜<sep>This is a great mom<sep>Great job Momma<sep>You are a wonderful mom.❤❤❤<sep>❤<sep>They learn to be much more polite from adults!❤❤❤<sep>💐💐💐✅✅✅👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻<sep>They want your attention hence fighting! Are there grandparents or single friends who can help with ocassional baby sitting?<sep>This a good mom, God bless here soul ❤❤❤<sep>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>That’s how my mom raised us . We were fighting with my sibling after that preaching from my mom and hugging and kissing . Now we have own families and we are very close to each other<sep>I say this all the time 😂<sep>These boys are descendants of Vikings. Fighting is in their DNA. It’s very hard to get them to stop completely. Unless you make them stop eating beef and be vegetarian’s.<sep>🌷 Great job mama! 🥰<sep>You such a super great mom❤❤❤<sep>not to dis your style but hudson has had it with the girls&#39; lifehacks for getting along.<sep>Little kids on sm is no good.<sep>I&#39;m a mom of 6 boys and I think that is called a sibling ban if it goes too far then You say something<sep>Thank you for being the best mom .. those tips will teach alot what is good parenting👍🏼❤<sep>WE ARE WATCHING THIS CHANNEL VERY CLOSEY AND HAVE CONTACTED LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON THIS FAMILY..IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT RUBY BLAKE CASE OF TERRIBLE CHILD ABUSE.  THIS CHANNEL HAS VERY SIMILAR  THINGS.  THE MOTHER SEEMS SIMILAR.  WE ARE CURRENTLY GOING THRU THIS CHANNEL AND FOWARDING THEM TO THEIR LOCAL CHILD PROT SERVICES N POLICE.<sep>What punishment do you implement if kids keep disobeying? If I do this &quot;pep talk&quot; 10x do I do it 10 more times? Do I sent to time out 10 more times...do I make them hug 10 more times. Just wondering if I can implement this gentle parenting with my kids<sep>Another good thing to do as a teacher is have them repeat back what you said. It helps them remember<sep>Why<sep>Talking don&#39;t help...pls stop....<sep>Without telling them to say sorry to each other, we can say “ what do you want to say to your brother “  😊<sep>Essential videos for everyone.<sep>GREAT JOB MOMA !!!❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊<sep>You are a good mother🎉<sep>Great parenting!!!<sep>A dream mom.<sep>Use DO instead of DO NOT <br>The brain doesn’t understand negation. You’re doing great. This would lift up your whole family. Saying No is ok of course. But after, correct the behavior with what is to do and the consequences if they do differently.<sep>Use the words&quot; we have nice hands..&quot;<br> then show them what that looks like.. and ask them to demonstrate it also❤ tell them to use their words!<sep>That first hug looked like a wrestling move.<sep>Let them fight dude, they learn from every experience.<sep>Why are they violent?<sep>How the little one hugs mom after being told not to hit brother...<br>Kids are so comforted by the clear boundaries you set.<sep>U r tha good Amma<sep>These boys are gonna be weak men<sep>At the early age like your kids, they should have reprimanded and let them understand what is right and wrong, how they show their respect with each other.",0

Thank the people of this country for NOT electing her!!!<sep>The only man whow won again woman in debate<sep>Lock him up!<sep>Thank the maker for DJT!!!<sep>She is so full of it xwhat a liar<sep>I would love to see Gordan Ramsey and Trump insult eachother<sep>Black Hispanic Americans for Trump!!<sep>&quot;My opponent is a turd sandwich.&quot;<br><br>&quot;YOU&#39;RE a turd sandwich!&quot;<sep>Just pay attention to those old who is running democratic.

Keep on deleting my comments ya little pathetic pissants. Keep it up 👏<sep>Both of them are members of the same club<sep>HILARY CLINTON TO ME IS THE SOURCE OF POLITICAL WRANGGLING IN AMERICA.<sep>🤣 “No your the puppet”. 😂<sep>That sip of water trump had you know he was ready for this<sep>Thank God hillary lost.<sep>When I ran for political office I lost and it was no contest.  Second place is the first loser and nobody in politics cares about losers.  Politicians tried to turn me into their puppet and they sort of wanted me involved with electing a woman.  Basically I am unmarried and I think women are stupid and incapable and this is just my core personality coming through.  One fact I learned in Politics is that there were things I did NOT like and electing a Woman is one of them.  I found working for a woman to be distasteful and she made me miserable.  But this is an interesting debate in light of Trump&#39;s recent comments to the effect that he would encourage Putin to attack NATO if countries did not pay their bills.  I am careful around politics and making political statements because I know this stuff is serious in America.  But our Presidents - powerful as they are under our Constitution - are NOT Dictators the way Putin is a Dictator, unless I really am just a Puppet.  This makes me think about myself and whether I am just a puppet.  The struggle to think for myself and realize the importance of success and earning money and having a life all come together in a debate like this between two titans of American Government.<sep>Years later SHE WAS RIGHT.<sep>This was the biggest &quot;NO U&quot; in politics.<sep>How does no one in the crowd laugh??<sep>Twisted sister :(<sep>Long live Trump!<sep>And it was all a lie<sep>God sake she was right<sep>trump2024<sep>Years later and the Democrats still have Russia on the brain<sep>CHINNNNAAAA<sep>SIT Woman....your husband was a puppet..<sep>Reminiscing on classic ments<sep>She was right. Everything she said he was going to do happened<sep>Based<sep>If a Dem president had met Putin and Kim Jon he or she’d have been given a peace prize. 😣🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱<sep>She bareface lied on the worldstage.<br>She paid Russia for the Steele dossier.<br>She sold yellow Uranium to Russia.<br>Everyone seems to forget unlike her he had zero motives to do anything for any country and that scared the establishment<sep>Putin ** moves hand and speaks from the side of his mouth **<br>&quot;no YOURE the puppet&quot;<sep>she is the biggest con ever<sep>All the Russia stuff she (and the democrats and MSM) said were not only found out to be untrue but to be intentional fabrications… <br><br>Anything that comes out of that woman’s mouth is a lie.<sep>We live for him<sep>At the end of the day, they are both puppets. Go up high enough and all U.S. politicians work for the same people. Even Trump.<sep>Why is the video not playable? Every other video is<sep>Thanks Tyrell, very cool.<sep>He was, and still Putin’s puppet<sep>Hilary was right<sep>And he was right<sep>Hi You Two!  You&#39;re braver than I am.  I can sit here and plan to go back in time (or to an earlier earth) with Enya and Bonnie Franklin to destroy Pompeii and the Titanic to get the same earth.  But how in the world do you guys explain all this?<br>Love, Don xoxo Happy New Year 2024!<sep>Watching this again after watching Mr. Robot<sep>No puppet lmfao<sep>Pure CIA RussiaGate lies by Hilldawg<sep>2016 happened I bet on it 100£ 🎉😂<sep>Man do we now KNOW SHE was behind the Russia lie😂<sep>I guess no one is laughing now. Its clear US made a mistake.<sep>Wow how things turned out. Trump years = Russia invaded no one, oil prices actually go into negative territory, Eliminating terrorist groups. <br>Under Democrat Presidents (Obama, Biden) - Russia invaded foreign countries, Russia threatens NATO countries, oil over $100/ barrel, Countries coming off of the $ as the world currency. I wonder who is the real puppets? The Grift is real Ladies and Gentlemen.<sep>Puppet? Puppet of the Illuminati?<sep>&quot;I&#39;m not a puppet! You&#39;re a puppet!&quot;<sep>Narrator: Trump was, in fact, the puppet. 😬<sep>Yesss he&#39;s watching you 😂<sep>Lol trump  🤣  and what look<sep>Trump is god<sep>Ask DHS whichever tribe they are 2023 September questiaire 😅<sep>Democrat telling on themselves again.

The Country would be in much better shape.<sep>She stands there accusing Trump of dealing with Russian...<br> When aa Trump was eldctec Hilarious Clinton and her campaign paid for the FAKE DOSSIER that led to the Russian Delusion. <br>What a witch.<sep>Hillary is a narcissistic Psychopathic monster who murdered a ten-year-old girl by torturing her to death and then drank her blood to get super high off of adrenochrome<sep>mirer<sep>join for us<sep>we are strong<sep>Putin wanted to join Nato.

She was the only candidate that made it a lock that Trump would become the president of the USA. So thanks Hilda.<sep>I&#39;m not the puppet you&#39;re the puppet<sep>I wouldn’t trust either of them, especially Hillary. She’s a pathological liar.<sep>Trump: no puppet no puppet<br><br>Also trump: your the puppet<sep>This didn’t age well, considering she was accusing him of the lies she personally made up.<sep>Mr. Robot brought me here<sep>I&#39;m rubber, you&#39;re glue. -Trump<sep>Hillary took him to school.<sep>Man people are so blind.<br><br>They can’t see who the real puppet is, or who acts like a real human being would !<sep>You can tell that puppet comment got under his skin and moved him off center, which is not very often<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVWRetR4jg&amp;t=9"">0:09</a><sep>No puppet, no puppet. hahahahahahahahaha<sep>it is now 2022, russians are cracking jokes that he sold them nuclear secrets he stole when he left the white house. His compound&#39;s been raided because he did, in fact, steal the nuclear football.<sep>He may as well have just said “I know you are but what am I?” Or “takes one to know one” 😂<sep>Haha.

When someone tells you who he is, believe him. Before most people had even voted in the 2020 election, Trump  said he wouldn&#39;t accept a loss. You think that has changed or do you think it is ok for him to lie and take over the government after losing an election cause he&#39;s your guy? Well many of those who thought similarly about Hitler ended up regretting that and many didn&#39;t live to see the end of WW2.  Is one third of the USA so clueless, easily-punked and uninformed about history (and every thing else) they can&#39;t spot a corrupt dangerous fascist when he makes it clear that is who he is? Wake up America! The reason the founders included Amendment 14 section 3 was not to punish those who&#39;d taken an oath and then participated or lead an insurrection. They included it because their goal was to safeguard Democracy. They knew that a person who&#39;d already tried to overthrow the government would try again if given the chance. Yeah yeah I get that nobody is supposed to compare anyone to Hitler but not doing so is a sure recipe for allowing someone to repeat Hitler&#39;s act. Trump exactly mirrors Hitler&#39;s acts before he took over Germany. One attempted coup down. Just like Hitler. Trump likes &quot;strong men&quot;. Strong men don&#39;t allow due justice. Nope. They just murder those they don&#39;t like Right now Trump can only use childiish insults to call out those who are critical of him. As soon as he can, he&#39;ll try harming his critics in any way possible. He says as much.  Wake up America! Don&#39;t give power to a  fascist dictator wannabe he took an oath to protect democracy and then tried to take over the government when he lost an election. Even kindergarten children know that refusing to accept an eclection loss is bad. Trump is bad.<sep>Ill stamd for that.

It seems he&#39;s taken it upon himself to dive headfirst into the gender pool, but instead of swimming, he&#39;s just making a splashy mess.<br><br>Supporting gender-affirming care for kids? Well, that&#39;s like trying to fix a leaky faucet with a sledgehammer. Sure, there are genuine cases where such care might be necessary, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves. Biden&#39;s approach seems to be more &quot;spray and pray&quot; than thoughtful consideration.<br><br>And don&#39;t even get me started on the new language and ideology he&#39;s enforcing. It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to rewrite the dictionary, tossing out words like &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;reality&quot; in favor of a rainbow-colored mishmash of confusion.<br><br>It&#39;s one thing to promote inclusivity and understanding, but quite another to bulldoze over common sense in the process. Biden&#39;s all aboard the gender train, chugging along full speed ahead, but it seems like the tracks are leading straight off a cliff.<br><br>So, hey Biden, turns out your support for gender-affirming care for kids is about as helpful as giving a fish a bicycle. And your enforcement of new language and ideology? Well, that&#39;s like trying to herd cats in a thunderstorm—lots of noise, lots of chaos, but not much progress. 🐟🚲🐱⛈<sep>He does not look like Biden does now!

Now there is a difficult political situation in your state because of Biden, Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin suspended international agreements and relations with you in order to save your life, because if the President of Russia continued to conduct international negotiations with you, Biden would have intervened in these negotiations and tried to remove you from the political arena because he he would consider that you are preventing him from pursuing a policy towards the destruction and genocide of the Ukrainian people by turning Ukraine into a fascist Bandera state in favor of Bider. Your task is to win the elections in 2024 with all your efforts, after your victory in the elections, Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin resumed relations with you and with all your efforts you will resolve the conflict in Ukraine. And also if you discuss the issue with Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin on helping to restore the automotive industry in the United States, I believe that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin will help you with this after Biden loses the election.<sep>Guys, answer me a question: is exporting LEFTIST to Cuba or Venezuela considered trafficking of DRUGS OR ANIMALS?<sep>Me responde uma coisa: exportar ESQUERDISTAS pra Cuba ou Venezuela e considerado tráfico de DROGAS OU ANIMAIS?<sep>❤❤❤A judge just ruled that your a Rapist right?

DwnugGAPxa0,Reason Norman Finkelstein speaks slowly.,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwnugGAPxa0,"Most important like you said “ attached more value at each word” I respect you so much for that Sir<sep>THIS GUY ... THIS GUY.... IS THE MAN..<sep>When you speak I listen! You articulate your points nice and clearly Norman and this is a great skill. Ignore those fools who are impatient.<sep>I really have something to do with this guy. We have a lot in common.<sep>One of the greatest souls of our time. May God have mercy on him❤<sep>Mr. Finkelstein. You are the voice of god saying the truth to express humanity. Thank you and may God bless you, Sir!<sep>People who think you speak slowly cannot delve into the depth of your words and don’t pause to reflect or learn. Otherwise they would make such absurd comments.<sep>Like you already said, dr Norman, that has nothing to do with the facts. Plus, we love you anyway dr.<sep>Articulated voice. Sensible<sep>Never boring even at that speed. People these days have a very short attention span 😂<sep>Surly it&#39;s what you say and not the speed of the words<sep>That&#39;s ridiculous does it matter and some people are never happy.<sep>Each of Dr. Finkelstein&#39;s sentences carries history, truth and facts. Something most of our politicians and academics don&#39;t value or don&#39;t know anymore - hence they either blabber or speak very fast in order for the gullible folks not to catch the many lies they&#39;re uttering. All self-confident people speak slowly as they have no problem with their statements being accurately recorded!<sep>That’s deep. I respect that.<sep>your speach is perfect ❤️<sep>One of humanities best.  Love you, Dr. F.<sep>I thought it was annoying at first, but have come to appreciate the rationale and the thoughtfulness behind your honest words. <br><br>Sadly there are some who will never “get it” no matter how you speak. They will always deny the truth.<br><br>God bless you, Dr. Finkelstein.<sep>I find a fall asleep while listening to this guy. Most people forget what he said in the beginning of the show.<sep>True jew  ❤ u<sep>💙💙💙💙<sep>Well said grandpa 🎉<sep>Keep speaking slow, there always be ears to listen to you 👏🏾<sep>Norman, you can speak as slow or fast you want to. I will listen.<br>I value your words because they are based on facts and honesty. <br>No Shapiro on speed could ever beat that.<sep>There is this false theory on the interwebs that speaking fast is a sign of intelligence. Mostly comes from dorks spending too much time comparing themselves to fast internet, fast cpu, etc...It&#39;s so sad.<sep>Brilliant!<sep>‘Urwah narrated that ‘Aishah said:<br><br><br>“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not speak quickly like you do now, rather he would speak so clearly, unmistakably, that those who sat with him would memorise it.” [Tirmidhi]<br><br>When the Apostle of the Allah (ﷺ) gave a talk, a man could count his words if he wished to count. [Abu Dawoud]<sep>He can speak as slowly as he wants. I could listen to him all day.<sep>Sir, you speak perfectly. The people turning the speed up are just used to listening to BS.<sep>Rather me dearest uncle you speak properly  clearly and to the point! Please keep on being awesome and Allah bless and protect you and yours<sep>You are the voice of justice and heavenliness dear professor. Keep going and tnx for your honesty and humanity❤<sep>EXACTLY! Mr. Finkelstein ALWAYS factually honest, sincere &amp; purposely doesn’t minced words! He refrains being quick 2 feelings from insults &amp; ignorant arguments! Always speak with Purpose!❤👍🏼<sep>Speaking slowly allows the listener to comprehend and reflect.<br>Rattling is used to steamroll the listener with garble, not with reason<sep>Speak with magnitude not attitude<sep>Dr. Finkelstien, you don&#39;t need to respond to rude jerks. We love what you have to say no matter what speed.<sep>The value of words❤ Go go Norm, you are hero<sep>CARRY ON NORMAN SPEAKING SLOWLY. YOU ARE A GREAT NARRATOR AND VERY CLEAR AND PRECISE. I AM PERSONALLY SICK &amp; TIRED OF PEOPLE GABBLING AT TWICE THE SPEAD OF LIGHT. THESE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY OVERSTIMULATED BY TECHNOLOGY AND VISUAL STIMULUS. THE DAMAGE THAT &quot;BILLY BOLLACKS TECHNOLOGY&quot; AND COMPUTERISATION HAS DONE IS UNTOLD. BEAUTIFUL HAND WRITING IS DEMINISHING, IN FACT SOME PEOPLES&#39; HAND WRITING IS APPALLING. MUCH LOVE NORMAN.<sep>I magine, if you spoke faster  while giving a lecture in an auditorium of an academic institution, most students wouldn&#39;t get and fail the class!<sep>Your speech is the best, most meaninhful, most accurate, most powerful, most sincere, moseloquent and to the point<br> The accusers need to go back to school or shut up and learn from you!<sep>You are the best speaker, worthy of this name, all things considered,  Dr Finkelstein!<br>Don&#39;t pay attention to the morons of this world.<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<sep>You are speaking just fine Sir<sep>Speak as slow as you like sir! I will always have time for you 👊🏾<sep>Salute you sir ....<br>You are the BEST EVER<sep>integrity doesn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t care<sep>u are a great asset to humanity. Thank u for everything sir.<sep>👍<sep>👏👏👏👏<sep>Salam, You good.<sep>N thats exactly why your words are very important.. your truth stands out..❤<sep>Keep utp  lik this, sir! Teach the world the human values.<sep>❤❤❤❤❤<sep>I admire his committment to the truths much<sep>Do not listen to ignorants, dear Proffessor.❤❤❤<br>They give everything to be you. But you are unique.<sep>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Self aggrandizement<sep>Great man<sep>You speak facts!<br>Idiots believe that speaking loud and fast makes them a winner.<sep>Thanks sir for speaking up from the humanity perspective...respect you<sep>Sounds like accusations comes from fascist who don’t want you to be heard by fair mind. Shall I nazis or Zionist. People aren’t fools🫵<sep>Some of us love the way you speak because every word you say carrys power a wisdom snd knowledge in all you say<sep>You speak PERFECT.<sep>Shapiro speaks quickly and sometimes adds valie as well. What&#39;s your point.<sep>I only experience your passion for what you believe in. It reflects your confidence in your utterances. You are just too brave and unshakable<sep>Also he doesn&#39;t have to keep repeating himself like some<sep>Beautiful<sep>Makes no difference fast or slow for your  $ prepaid  lies.<sep>You are a legend in our times sir❤<sep>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>My advice is, God bless you and to the day of judgment, for saying the truth, and stand up for humanity<sep>This man is a hero a man of God<sep>Sir Finkelstein you do well, thank you for telling all this 👍<sep>Respect…<sep>Your words make me remember by deceased father who used to speak slowly in National level .. with International leaders like Kissinger, Anwar Sadat, Marshal Tito &amp; others!<br>Still photo available let us see how keenly listening him.<br>Each word have great value!<br>Thank you for your slow speech!<br>No hatred or over excitement express!<br>A man of knowledge should follow you.<sep>You are soft spoken .. words are heavy!<sep>Perfectly right, is a man who speaks, with the speed of truth and light.<sep>WHETHER HE SPEAKS SLOWLY OR RAPIDLY, NO SINGLE WORD ARTICULATED BY FINKELSTEIN HAS ANY TRULY LEGITIMATE VALUE.<sep>Your speech is perfect!<sep>Those who rattle always try to cover the lies, as for you who seal the truth  it hurts them and the educated are the ones who value their words.<sep>He speaks slowly because he has to remember his last lie<sep>Incorrect. Italians speak very fast. It’s got nothing to do with valuing each word<sep>It doesn&#39;t matter how you speak bcz what you speak matters most as you touch our hearts ❤❤🎉🎉<sep>I love the calmness of how you approach your speeches. Laying down one fact after one fact. Very articulate. You will go down in history as one of the best Jews who has protected human life and injustices perpetrated against a folk who have no powerful nations backing. I salute you..!<sep>You speak just fine<sep>His talks are eloquent<sep>He is great his analysis his talking his views of judgement is miraculous<sep>God bless you, you are a true gentleman<sep>Your Words do have Value👍<sep>May Allah bless this guy and guide to Islam. Most active person for the people of Palestine.<sep>An ultimate beautiful soul... The world needs so many more like him ... God bless him<sep>I don’t care what speed you speak at: you’re honest, humane , kind , considerate, compassionate and brave free person. Your speaking speed is irrelevant to remaining decent people in this humanity.<sep>I like it its reassuring and refreshing, when most just mumble now and fastm<sep>Dr Norman, we love you no matter what you do ❤<sep>Scriptural truth. Think before speaking. Tongue is the most evil organ in body.<sep>You speak however you wish sir!<sep>This dude went so fucking slow I forgot it was a loop.<sep>This dude sounds like Mike Tyson<sep>I speak several languages, and I don&#39;t use filler words such as &quot;um&quot; or &quot;like&quot;. As a result, I speak slowly and pause when I&#39;m searching for the most precise word or phrase to convey my intended meaning. When I pause, however, some people interpret the pause as their turn to speak, even when it&#39;s clearly evident that I haven&#39;t finished my sentence or thought. To me, that&#39;s an indicator that they weren&#39;t really listening to what I was saying, but rather just waiting for an opportunity for them to start talking again.<sep>Awe, a person who thinks before he speaks.  How refreshing.<sep>No Ummm, no Uhhhh, no Like, this and like, that, 😂  Take a lesson before you ax a question.<sep>Listening to him speak is like watching paint dry, and it has nothing to do with his intelligence. 🙄",0

Joe follows Obama cause Joe can&#39;t think for him self.<sep>That&#39;s pretty funny. And all the little MAGAts comments about how old and forgetful President Biden is is also pretty funny. But note how a real president, a real mature adult, a real leader handles this situation instead of acting like a little b!tch and deride anyone or run off and fire dozens of deranged tweets. President Biden is the kind of president I want running things, in the same way that President Obama did a great job leading the country. 🙏👏<sep>Wow the 2 guys that love kids more than P Diddy 👍<sep>Thats because Obama knows he&#39;s pulling the strings at the Whitehouse, not Biden.<sep>LoL not a joke<sep>Why does Kamala make everything feel so weird<sep>I think he pooped...<sep>That was not a joke.

We know who is in charge and causing issues<sep>What do you call three jerks under one roof? You seen it you name it.<sep>Such a liar, pretender and hypocrite.

xHC_qFPeXt0,Putin Says LGBTQ Community Is Part of Russian Society,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said the LGBTQ community is part of society while Russian authorities asked the Supreme Court to declare the LGBTQ 'movement' extremist.Speaking at the cultural forum in St. Petersburg on Friday, Putin said it's required to show the life of the LGBTQ community when competing at cultural contests in Western countries, but added that they have the right to do so.""This is also part of society, this is what people live for. It's only bad if they are the only ones to win the competition,"" Putin said.On the same day, the Russian Justice Ministry said it has filed a lawsuit with the nation's Supreme Court to outlaw the LGBTQ+ “international public movement” as extremist, the latest crippling blow against the already beleaguered LGBTQ+ community in the increasingly conservative country.The ministry said in an online statement announcing the lawsuit that authorities have identified “signs and manifestations of extremist nature” in “the activities of the LGBT movement active"" in Russia, including “incitement of social and religious discord.”Russia's Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing to consider the lawsuit for Nov. 30, the ministry said.It is not yet clear what exactly the label would entail for LGBTQ+ people in Russia if the Supreme Court sides with the Justice Ministry, and the ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But the move in itself represents the latest, and possibly by far the most drastic, step in the decade-long crackdown on gay rights in Russia unleashed under President Vladimir Putin, who has put “traditional family values” at the cornerstone of his rule.--------Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmSubscribe to Bloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/BloombergTVBloomberg Quicktake brings you global social video spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

PssB-GNRvDU,Trump makes threat if re-elected,CNN political commentator SE Cupp weighs in on former President Donald Trump’s comments at a rally In South Dakota threatening to indict his future political opponent if re-elected. #CNN #News #Trump,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PssB-GNRvDU,"He was talking about Biden they are leaving out content<sep>Donald whines too much<sep>No! Trump is emboldened. He thinks he is doing a good thing for the States.  If he is found guilty and he&#39;s president, can he parden himself?<sep>Liberals have got to be the dumbest people on planet earth.<sep>What a sick twisted person<sep>Trump 2024<sep>Mr Trump u must win!! You r our only hope for American!!! Love you &amp; thank you!!!!<sep>Propaganda as usual.<sep>God please stop democrats from cheating again we need trump back so bad<sep>He&#39;s making fun of the charges Biden&#39;s administration has thrown at him...<sep>Trump needs prison asap worst sadistic person weve ever had!<sep>This lady is a nut<sep>SHAME ON CNN for airing and engaging in codependent propaganda!  Discussing and soooo shameful.<sep>That was not a threat that was a promise 👌🏻🤠😎<sep>Are they stupid?<sep>If this is how you react to that statement you’re either incredibly autistic or you’re purposefully misinterpreting it in bad faith.<sep>And to think SE Cupp USED to be a &#39;conservative&#39;.  It&#39;s a shame, for her.<sep>Oooh, I think they didn&#39;t get the joke!  And it doesn&#39;t surprise me one bit.  It&#39;s not that these people have absolutely no sense of humour.  It&#39;s that they pretend (for political purposes) to take everything he says dead literally because they think it somehow suits their purposes?  How?  It makes them look like brain dead scolds!  Who would want to be on THAT side?  Wow!!<sep>What’s unfortunate is whatever she’s explaining won’t reach the audience that will eventually vote for trump. They have the attention span of a squirrel. Whatever trump feeds them is correct according to trump besides he flips the narrative all the time whatever he does or he allegedly did some else is done or doing it. He’s a con man<sep>it missed her completely..<sep>These people are sick!<sep>Mr trump you can learn and open the bank and insurance, it is alot money in there ya.<sep>He’s mocking Biden!! CNN back at it again<sep>TDS still strong i see<sep>These reporters are BS. All Trump is saying is that if he wants to act like the current administration is acting, that’s what he’d do BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO HIM RIGHT NOW. Stop acting like you’re stupid journalists, you know what you’re doing and it’s extremely poor journalism.<sep>Dictator wanna be<sep>But you were indicted for real crimes...<sep>He keeps warning us.

PROOF is out that PELOSI  REFUSED his guards and also took his full speech out where he said &quot;Go peacefully&quot; ...<br>Spew your garbage because the more truth that comes out makes the stulity laughable<sep>It&#39;s what CNN does , take a statement out of context and make it sound like a threat<sep>Trump isn&#39;t a rational person<sep>she mad<sep>Our once strong CIA would of delt with Trump long ago,since no agency has stood ip to him he&#39;s going to keep pushing our administration and foundation to the limit!<sep>Are you people really this stupid do you expect anyone to take what Mr. Trump seriously for real are you really gonna play stupid and act like what he said wasn’t him joking. <br>This is the reason people HATE YOU PEOPLE AT CNN THE LIES AND FAKE SHIT YOU GET ON WITH even a four-year-old could tell he was joking.

Biden has broken all laws people&#39;s right from A to Z<sep>It’s literally mockery of exactly what the democrats are doing to trump using the legal system as a weapon to stop him from winning instead of having a fair election it’s some dictator type stuff<sep>CNN has plenty of koolaid for people to drink<sep>give him mood he give you view<sep>This lady is delusional 😮<sep>I hate CNN with a passion. They are the devil and a great reason why the country is falling.

When NY said, you owe money, make payments, take a fine. Not Trump. When NARA said give up the Records, or we talk to the DoJ. Trump said no. When the DoJ said, give up the records and all is forgiven, Trump hid the records. This man makes BAD CHOICES. He ruined the economy once. Why give him another chance? Just to cut taxes on billionaires?<sep>He has done nothing just like your pos in there now fu. N fjb<sep>Maybe if the political system was honest and the government was honest this would not be happening to make people away of this foolish behavior by the media and corrupt politicians???<sep>The democrats denied the outcome of the 2016 election, obtained a FISA warrant based on bogus information so they could spy on trumps campaign, they even launched a two year investigation at tax payers expense that came up empty.<sep>What an assh.......I can&#39;t say it on YouTube without getting one of their &quot;you offended someone&quot; popups.<sep>Biden said he would take the train across that bridge that fell in the water when that bridge didnt have train tracks. Why doesnt cnn do a story on that?<sep>CNN loves certain words said next to each other and then theyll cut out everything before and after those certain words that wer said.<sep>Biden has done it to trump and is still doing it.

oTdZaiSRwqI,What Is The Observable Universe?,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTdZaiSRwqI,"I got a question 🙋 IF ALL THE UNIVERSE ITS EXPANDING IN AL DIRECTIONS AT ALL TIMES IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EXPANDING TO!???<sep>Wouldn&#39;t that mean objects past the edge are traveling faster than the speed of light?<sep>You better tell (YOUR)!!!PEOPLE, TO RUN TO JESUS!!!! CAUSE [&quot;(THAT)&quot;]!!!! MEANS SOMETHING, AND IT DON&#39;T SOUND GOOD!!<sep>That sounds like the mahamudra.<sep>Exquisitely articulated! Thank you Dr Tyson! Your description of light and its energy signature is easy to comprehend. 🎉🪐<sep>Have you kissed yourself on a mirror lately (just on the lips) ?<sep>Here is a question from an interested amateur. Wouldn’t the red shifted light just enter the infrared part of the em spectrum?  Is there an instrument that can detect that wavelength?<sep>You are that dude 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🎉<sep>...And the earth was not made in 7 earth days. Think about it.<sep>So meaning it&#39;s really impossible to see without specific cameras, even tho it&#39;s not visible doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. Nd if light bands aren&#39;t being able to produce the energy, still could mean there&#39;s other galaxies space dust just elements of all kinds we may not have discovered yet. Just a theory<sep>Or the only thing moving away from us is not what we see but what we can&#39;t yet see so by expanding what we see only this can ourselves expanding not the universes<sep>Love how you make me understand about universe..Agreed with the comment about the shirt,it&#39;s dope ❤<sep>Awesome shirt! Where can I get one?<sep>😮😮 I forgot.<sep>Thank you for explaining that.<sep>My dudes and we cannot even see the macroscopic let alone the observed universes😊<sep>Your videos have the audio track&#39;s volume too low (compared to other youtube videos). Please get it correctly, it&#39;s annoying to have to adjust the volume everytime I want to watch your videos.<sep>Shirt drops credibility 40%,get rid of it.<sep>Neil. I&#39;m Luke Day. (Real name).<br><br>I am a big fan of yours and I love StarTalk.<br><br>Here&#39;s an elogently simple question: Why don&#39;t you work at SpaceX? <br><br>Ok, bare with me. <br><br>Now that ive got that off my chest, i really wanted to know whether your skillset is appropriate for helping the engineers with the mars colonisation project or are they exclusively preoccupied with rocket science due to having already consulted your people on the the astronomical aspects?<br><br>Is it the case that they might ask &#39;astrophysicists&#39; a series of questions in some kind of meeting early on in the project and then take those data and move on to solving logistical problems such as fuel and delta v etc? Or is there a relevant role for &#39;your people&#39; with the entire mars project moving forward?<br><br>Will your people study the STARS... on MARS?<sep>Got a question?Just ask Neil!<sep>but what is beyond the observable horizon? using light alone we can never know….<sep>It&#39;s big, really big yet most humans still think it is a long way to the corner store......<sep>My head hurts. Again. Why do I watch him?  Oh.  My head is expanding. I love you man. 😊<sep>I greatly enjoy his explanation of astrophysics clearly and understandable<sep>Finally a spectacular explanation ! ... if I understand correctly: not that that galaxy isn&#39;t there, but that at some point its &quot;distance&quot; from us eclipsed infinitely dissipated EM energy such that we can&#39;t observe it anymore ..... Have we observed that eclipsing ? ... If infinitely dissipated EM energy had dissipated non-linearly, wouldn&#39;t we potentially observe the eclipsing at least once in our astronomically temporally-narrow observatory ?<sep>Tyson himself has expanded so much that parts of him are not observable anymore.<sep>I love how scientists can explain what we don’t know and what we can’t see so well that it makes sense. 😊<sep>Coolest shirt in  the cosmos!!! Right out from space jam😂😂😂<sep>I want that shirt. Where can i get it?<sep>Nice shirt.<sep>I find what he said to be very sad. If another galaxy that has lifeforms in it is moving away from us at a very fast pace we&#39;ll never get the chance to interact or meet such lifeforms.<sep>Do the telescopes we&#39;ve sent into space create little bumps on the observable universe?<sep>Toby From Nigeria 🇳🇬 🙌 I actually Understood ❤<sep>Ok Neal, now I’m confused. Using that old example of a car traveling at the speed of light and then the driver turns on the lights, are you saying that for everything at that limit, the car is traveling away from us at the speed of light and the light from the taillights is traveling back towards us at the same speed and therefore there is no relative movement of the photons from our perspective, and thus no light observed?<sep>თესლი ზედაა შეჩ :D<sep>Wow....i actually understood it.😅<sep>That is the EVENT HORIZON of the observable universe.<sep>If you don’t care about mental health (transgender) then I don’t care about you and your universe ✨<sep>What a great shirt<sep>I love you Neil!❤<sep>The Very Defined size of the Observable Universe!?  The James Webb Telescope facts begs to differ!<sep>So let me see if I got this straight. If the universe is expanding in all directions then we must be in the absolute center. Is that correct?<sep>That&#39;s just so fracking cool!!! Gods damned, I wish I was smart enough to do what you do!!!<sep>Neil is only willing to appear in front of the camera if he is wearing a piece of clothing with a pattern related to the sky. It can be a jacket, shirt, or tie. He pays close attention to this rule, which he created for himself.<sep>I think there’s the possibility of a mistake in the red shift because we cannot wrap our minds around the possibility of observing the universe going faster than the speed of light<sep>And now as we talk about how well defined the universe is we find that it is expanding at different rates in different directions breaking some of the explanations and raising questions we thought were answered and now need further investigation and analysis.<sep>Barely audible. It&#39;s not my system- everything else is 5 x 5<sep>But what is it expanding into? Is that not also the universe? Do we have any mathematics that suggest how big it may be?<sep>If a given galaxy farthest or diameter, will it still be detectable after years as it&#39;s drifting away at such an enormous amount amount of speed?<sep>“My People”………Astrophysicist!!<sep>We&#39;re actually in a black hole, what you&#39;re seeing is the horizon of it.<sep>What about the other universe sis<sep>The Universe is an illusion…_…<sep>The universe is not expanding.  Galaxies are simply moving into the empty parts of the universe.<sep>or, the universe is flat and the &quot;redshift&quot; is just the galaxy falling out of the plate<sep>So, you&#39;re sayin&#39; that whatever &#39;your people&#39; have to say is WRONG right out of the gate....  OK.<sep>Is the observable universe expanding?<sep>So we can never know what’s past that point?<sep>LMFAO. That&#39;s the best explanation for Red shifting ever! I understood it immediately when he said, the expansion is diluting the energy. That&#39;s why NDT is awesome.<sep>For a guy that knows a lot of useless information, he sure get paid a lot of money.<sep>I&#39;d have &#39;assumed&#39;, being closer to one side vs the other might make the difference, but what I&#39;m coming to understand is we can&#39;t actually observe just how big creation really is.   Damn...<sep>Thanks, Dr. Tyson.<br>If only everyone could mean &quot;My people&quot; in the same sense you do.<sep>Happy Blessed Oyster day to you Neil n Chuck Huggies<sep>my guy thinks hes the next albert einstein<sep>Keep the knowledge coming, Sir. ❤ it!! Fascinating!!<sep>I could almost see what you just said.<sep>Neil just wishes he could come up with a decent catchphrase like &quot;Billions and billions,&quot; Give it up Neil!<sep>I suspect &quot;his people&quot; can&#39;t stand him.<sep>PROF NEIL CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT THE CERN EXPERIMENT PLANNED FOR 8TH APRIL AND THE &quot;BIBLICAL CONSPIRACES&quot; AND OTHER PROPHESYIES AROND THIS.........I must say it is a runaway train if James Stanley is to be believed......      <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KueLOv60daU"">https://youtu.be/KueLOv60daU?si=MDSXv8dNtYuvhtB-</a><sep>Can flat earth shrews understand any of this?<sep>Nothing about the size of the universe makes sense to the why of it.<sep>So are you saying the &quot;edge&quot; we can observe may not be the definitive edge of the expanding universe which is how we define the time since the big bang? There could be more galaxies beyond this edge meaning the universe is older than we thought?<sep>...Where he you get that shirt?  It&#39;s literally the same as mine, and mine&#39;s homemade<sep>...and the quantification of that limit is?<sep>If the furthest stars are moving fastest enough to feed shift to infinity. Does that mean that relative to us the stars are traveling faster than the speed of light?<sep>Wow. That makes my head hurt to think about what is beyond the observable universe. Is what we can see just a drop in the ocean? The woods beyond our backyard just got bigger. Lol<sep>I wish he was my teacher when i was a kid<sep>And as I understand it, stuff is disappearing past the threshold of observability all the time. What I&#39;m left to wonder is how big the &quot;actual&quot; universe is and how much stuff there is in it (the observable plus the unobservable).<sep>Love that t shirt ❤<sep>Awesome shirt. You are the universe.<sep>Redshifted to 0 Hz, actually.<sep>So if everything is moving away from us.....then we must be the center of the universe.........<sep>Is it also every thing inside Hubble Horizon<sep>So, having said that Neil…as we begin exploring outside of the Solar System…into the Milky Way proper, does that mean the observable Universe  expands apace with our explorations?<sep>My mind was just expanded to infinity.😊<sep>is the andromeda inside that then<sep>Soo, is that 13.8b light years away? If so, why is it said that the universe is only 13.8b years old? Seems to me that the universe is infinite, but we can only see so far.<sep>We , as humans can only comprehend what a human being can. So, we are limited to the box 📦 we can observe. But, there’s more in our planet 🌎 we need to investigate 🔬 and learn from as well, because what’s out there, here is what we and everyone , everything is within us . 🧍‍♂️ And 🧍‍♀️ 🦒 🦓 🦔🪿<sep>Redshirt is still the best and the fast renderer for C4D.....<sep>So some galaxies move faster than the speed of light?   hmm<sep>Sounds like we&#39;re in a black hole???🤔🤔🤔<sep>Red shifted to infinity AND beyond. By beyond, the source has gone beyond the point where its light can no longer reach us because the space itself has stretched (inflation) so they (their location in space) is moving away from our point literally faster than the speed of light. Eventually every galaxy will be that far away from it&#39;s nearest other galaxy, while beforehand close galaxies will merge due to gravity if they are heading in roughly the same direction.<sep>&quot;Redshift&quot;<br>It&#39;s like the Dopler effect but for light instead of sound.🤓<sep>When Neil says “ My People “ he doesn’t mean My people ✊🏾… 😂<sep>universe has no size or weight, universe is just an illusion... you will see when you die :*<sep>How much longer does the universe have before this energy dilution changes the nature of the universe as we kniw it?<sep>Woww<sep>Great explanation<sep>I want Neil&#39;s shirt!<sep>Thank you, Dr. Tyson, for clarifying the concept of the &quot;edge of the universe&quot; meant for me.<br><br>I&#39;ve had the idea of horizon bring the &quot;standing in a beach model&quot; where space would bend beyond our ability to see what may be beyond the horizon. <br><br>lt was not clear what horizon if the visible universe really meant.<br><br>Horizon is not the curvature of space (as standing in a beach model would entitle), but the speed in which the expansion takes place at the &quot;edge&quot; of what&#39;s visible in our 3D spherical universe buble.<br><br>At those speeds light &quot;dilutes&quot; to the point of being currently undetectable, and that&#39;s  the edge for our current instruments.<br><br>The &quot;dilution&quot; of the visible light is the horizon, nothing more.<br><br>And the speed of expansion makes whatever may be beyond that point invisible to us.<br><br>We may live in an infinite universe afterall.",0
1MrTKuOOe54,Obama: Race has always been ‘the fault line’ in American politics,Former President Barack Obama speaks with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in a wide-ranging interview about the importance of preserving democracy in the US and around the world. #CNN #News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MrTKuOOe54,"Mr Former Preßident Obama i need my insurance for myhealth...<sep>He bombed an African country what a joke !!<sep>OH! HOGWASH!<br><br>WE NEED MOOR&#39; MONEY!!! 💰 <br><br>WE, THE AFRICAN PEOPLES IN AMERICA 🇺🇸,  WE NEED MOOR&#39; ECONOMIC PARITY AND POLITICAL POWER. WE KNOW, NOW, THAT THE OBAMAS WAS A PLANT. IN A WORD, OBAMA WAS A &quot;JEWISH PRESIDENT&quot;.<sep>Race and racial tension has always been a tool of divisive democrats like Obama. He created a victim culture in minority communities   which he used for political advantage. Democrats now routinely use an agenda of victimhood and hate to separate Americans from each other.<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MrTKuOOe54&amp;t=37"">0:37</a><sep>Lmao it’s pretty funny how good at politics he his. Then immediately turning those statements on its head. <br>Ok so what was those middle eastern and border laws that he supported or created that now Democrats supported for years which now they know call republicans racist.<br><br>Holy shit and this “uniting” president conflated all gender talk about sexist stereotypes vs the literal me too movement? Yeah this guy is such a poser and people think his carefully worded and well spoken attitude isn’t a guise to demean his opponents<sep>Pure class, intelligence and charisma. SO eloquently spoken. The last 8 years the White House has been a reality show.<sep>Let be real...<br>Many didn&#39;t accept President Obama mainly because of his race. .<br>That is the truth...<br>He been one of the best President in current US history...<br>He did everything in an ethical matter. .<br>He was able to reach all kind...<br>He was the people&#39;s President...<br>Yet even now people been hard on him...<br>Some extreme racist have threaten his life !!!!<sep>That&#39;s exactly why the democrats try to keep the black people down,,They use it in every election to get votes<sep>It wasn&#39;t always like this.  It can&#39;t stay this way for long either.  It creates too much pain.<br><br>Stay decent and have faith in others to return to that way someday.<sep>Mutual cooperation is assured once the Dems complete their totalitarian stranglehold powergrab<sep>jail for this subhuman!!<sep>Terrible<sep>Obama was the last time the US had a smart, reasoned, articulate leader<sep>OMG he is so intelligent omg he speaks so well so soft unreal how quickly people forget all one person has to do is sweettalk you. Zink and hook 😮<sep>Obama is all probability must be the worst president America ever had<sep>I don’t agree with every policy of Obamas, but I do miss having a US president that could speak coherently and not make batshit decisions.<sep>NO. Not until you made it so. The fault line has always been CLASS.<sep>He pretty much hit on what I&#39;ve come to see (or, in fairness, been taught?) as the three biggest weaknesses in America: racism, sexism, and our Gini index (difference between rich and poor). All of these things are needless stumbling blocks to our progress as a nation. The first two are tools that fall readily to hand for the wealthiest 0.01% who want to keep all the rest of our noses to the grindstone, and definitely don&#39;t want to pay for medicaid for their underpaid seasonal workers.<sep>I’d like to tell Obama and Michelle, how I feel.  Obama is not a patriot, he is an eloquent thug  traitor like Satan.  I heard a prophesy about Obama during the 1960’s.  Obama destroyed our nation.<sep>The world held Germany&#39;s WWII history up to the world and dragged Germany through the mud and made the Germany atone in front of the world and Germany did that and is still doing that.  Meanwhile, America cannot face and admit 450 years of behaviur and America is the loser.<sep>Obama needs some jail time!<br>Hypocrisy!<br>The nest worst president after Biden<br>What don&#39;t you ask him where his fortune comes from???<sep>And he has done nothing to heal that fault line<sep>Obama &quot;The Manchurian President&quot;  has ties to Socialists/Communists and anti-American sentiment.<br>His biggest fault and he has many was settleling millions of illegals aliens into this country! He is not to be trusted . . .<sep>आसा की किरनो से छाया सादगी का आकार तो चाहतो के लिये भी रहा कलियों का आकार <br><br>चमन की तरह छाया सादगी का रन्ग तो खाबो से भी खिलते है सादगी का बहार<br><br><br>चमन की तरह छाया इनायत का पहरा तो बहारो के लिये मिलतें है जीवन का किरदार<sep>Yeah ! Blame American politics when you could have help the country get over that ,but your self righteous attitude prevented you from doing anything to improve the country so don’t let it become politics! You failed at everything to make a difference.<sep>I’m really glad I voted for him. The repeal of “Don’t ask, Don’t tell” to disgrace lgbt in the military was a huge achievement. Osama Bin Laden killed in his administration. The NSA scandal was concerning for sure, but thanks to Edward Snowden for allowing us civilians to see what our government was up to.<sep>Really the Democratic party  WAS the KKK....¡!!!!!??!<sep>What a joke.

In the US, where no one starves and everyone has access to health care and basic social services.

All he ever talks about is equality with race and other countries.  He wishes to knock down the white man who built this country, but Trump doesn&#39;t have all his problems with racial and colonialism resentment and totally talks about prosperity and money.

His real father is Barrey Soetaro from Kenya Subud Tribe.<sep>I&#39;m out.<sep>obama is a racist, he hates the Jews<sep>I didn’t like some things about Obama, but he was definitely the most respectful president we’ve had in the 21st Century.  People were more polite and less violent when he was president.  Anyone else feel that way?<sep>No way should he have been president before a white female concerning behaviors and the history of the United States government presidents how I mean as it&#39;s more disrespectful towards white females to never let one be president and yes I said let one be because obviously there&#39;s better behaving and far more amazing white females than Barack Obama is of behaving and so on such as there&#39;s certainly better females than Barack is concerning quality and leadership and so on how I mean who would have been better presidents than Barack Obama and so on and yet the white females can raise families, run businesses and so on, but people voted in a black man by being racist to vote in the first black person who is a male. The United States government should be ashamed of it&#39;s self and how it sabotages it&#39;s own government by being sexist and racist and so on how I mean and that&#39;s also in my notes about the United States government. It&#39;s not acceptable for any government to treat white females and white males so horrible and yet black people get their own racist channel called Black entertainment television and racist sayings of black lives matter as they disrespect the rest of the human race. I&#39;m tired of the United States government and how it disrespected white males through my life who aren&#39;t racist and aren&#39;t sexist how I mean and having to deal with such a horrible government and how it treats white men who aren&#39;t sexist and are males who stand up for our best mothers and so on because the are humans who matter because of behaviors and I, Michael say it publicly that it&#39;s disrespectful towards our mothers and so on including us who think we have amazing females of the human race to regardless of you sexist and racist government employees! I don&#39;t see Barack standing up for females correctly at all how I mean concerning such and yet he thinks he&#39;s a leader worthy of being a president. I have been doing such since a little child so get over yourself Barack Obama. There&#39;s much better leaders than you and some are females!<sep>Please make Donald trump go to prison and not leave.

This was on his watch!<br>Hunter Biden and his associates were running a classic influence peddling operation using Joe Biden as what Devon Archer called “the Brand.”[1] While this was described as an “illusion of access,” millions were generated for the Bidens from some of the most corrupt figures in the world, including associates who were later accused of or convicted of public corruption.[2]<br>* Some of the Biden clients pushed for changes impacting United States foreign policy and relations, including help in dealing with Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigating corruption.[3]<br>* President Biden has made false claims about his knowledge of these dealings repeatedly in the past, including insisting that he had no knowledge of Hunter’s foreign dealings which Archer has declared “patently false.”[4] The Washington Post and other media outlets have also declared the President’s insistence that his family did not take money from China as false.[5]<br>* The President had been aware for years that Hunter Biden and his uncle James were accused of influence peddling, including an audiotape of the President acknowledging a New York Times investigation as a threat to Hunter.[6]<br>* President Biden was repeatedly called into meetings with these foreign clients and was put on speakerphone.[7] He also met these clients and foreign figures at dinners and meetings.[8]<br>* Emails and other communications show Hunter repeatedly invoking his father to secure payments from foreign sources and, in one such message, he threatens a Chinese figure that his father is sitting next to him to coerce a large transfer of money.[9]<br>* A trusted FBI source recounted a direct claim of a corrupt Ukrainian businessman that he paid a “bribe” to Joe Biden through intermediaries.[10]<br>* Hunter Biden reportedly claimed that he had to give half of his earnings to his father[11] and other emails state that intermingled accounts were used to pay bills for both men, including a possible credit account that Hunter used to allegedly pay prostitutes.[12]<br>* At least two transfers of funds to Hunter Biden in 2019 from a Chinese source listed the President’s home in Delaware where Hunter sometimes lived and conducted business.[13]<br>* Some of the deals negotiated by Hunter involved potential benefits for his father, including office space in Washington.[14] At least nine Biden family members reportedly received money from these foreign transfers, including grandchildren.[15] For Hunter Biden, this included not just significant money transfers but gifts like an expensive diamond and a luxury car.[16]<sep>Obama should be a president 1 more time because a lot of people love him inside and outside the U.S<sep>In my opinion, by far the most intelligent and necessary President America needed and misses till this day.  Although I find it to be a little concerning that he is still very careful with his words, he understands that as a former President, he has a responsibility that stretches far beyond the Oval Office.  He is the epitome of class, grace, respect and compassion in the face of an ever changing America that finds itself moving away from those core values.  <br><br>We sometimes underestimate the value of a “steady hand” at the wheel until we find the bus over the cliff.  President Obama provided then and still provides that steady hand.   Soooo as much as I wish that he would go scorched earth on his loudest critics, I am equally reminded that that is not his style nor his brand…..and that is something I can respect!<sep>Its amazing how you tube pads the numbers when it fits their narrative.<sep>You&#39;re a Dik<sep>정치라는것<br>신세계가 아니죠<br>아직 이세상은<br>모든문제들이 제거된건 아닌<br><br>그런데 미국은 오바마이후 트럼프놈대통 전세계시끄러웠고<br>그다지 미국경제 부흥한것도 아니었죠<br>도리어 그는 이민정책 부모자식 떼놓기까지 천륜저버리는 만행질까지<br><br>그런트럼프놈을<br>다시 세우려고 하는겁니까?<br>미국시민여러분 뭣때문에요?<br>트럼프놈때문에<br>한국한반도땅<br>자칫 세계3차대전 터질뻔했죠<br>이라크미사일날리듯 한반도에 그랬다면 바로..<br><br>히틀러 위대한지도자인가?<br>아니죠<br>마귀씌인놈이었죠<br>지도자한사람때문에<sep>This man is no good for the United States<sep>Words that should be off limits to politicians.

All of the mentioned above is BRITISH EMPIRE FOREIGN POLICY.<br>Its ANGLO-SAXONS - not Europeans. They are  not even considered civilized people.....<sep>They are cowards<sep>The houthis didn&#39;t stand for Palestinians, it was Iran that told the houthis to start attacking random ships in the red sea. Where were the Houthis when hundreds of Iranian women were killed for not wearing headscarves. Where was Iran and the Arab world when ISIS butchered yezadis and kurds and 100 of thousands more in Iraq and Syria. Looks like you really need some lessons on Iranian proxies in the middle East and the havoc they wreck everywhere. And also nothing can justify the war crimes happening in Gaza ,  32000 killed in 6 months, totally unacceptable.<sep>Lenin called people like this Finkelstein guy just “useful idiots”<sep>Proof that Class A drugs are bad for you. 😮<sep>Maybe because Palestinians are wrong?<sep>This is a man with balls.<sep>You are right all the way<sep>Tell them Finkelstein!!!<sep>Wow 👍🏼<sep>The most barbaric crimes against humanity,happened in Europe,by europians, in the name of &quot;european civilisation&quot;.<sep>I never never knew this man until October 2023 and now listen to him nearly daily for 6 months, He learned and unshakable.

Makes you cry to see Palestine suffer like this<sep>Says a lot for the Hoothis and it&#39;s sad that Biden could have stopped this. Netanyahu told so many lies.

Lebanon (always stand by Palestinians) &amp; Syrians (&amp; I think indirectly Turkey no??) But YOU&#39;RE right regardless...as ever Europe &amp; Germany (in particular) are a disgrace! I  march to scream not in my name because I live in the UK don&#39;t forget their are millions on Europe who are part of the RESISTANCE  by marching, sending money &amp; helping get people out of Gaza .... some journalists doing over &amp; above to support GAZA...thank you for all that you do.. ❤<sep>Palestinian Activist 😂<sep>THANK YOU SIR NORMAN 👏👏👏..RESPECT 🫡🫡🫡..May Allah protect you 🤲🤲🤲☝️..Free Palestine Insha Allah 🤲🤲🤲☝️🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸<sep>Dr. Finkelstein is not plugged to the matrix. God bless you and keep you in good health sir. You&#39;re a man of courage and honor.<sep>Finkelstein talks as though only the Gazans have a claim to human dignity. What about the Israelis who were murdered, tortured and taken captive? Do they not have these same rights. And since when is murder and mutilation (not to mention rape) a defense of human rights? As for the Houthis: they rose up against Israel and &#39;the West&#39; as a tribal act of solidarity and/or at the behest of Iran. Nothing to do with our concept of human rights. But thanks for trying, Norman.<sep>The only righteous candidate that deserves a Nobel Peace award is this brave man. Time will always tell the truth.<sep>Finkelstein, a Mahatma !<sep>One trick pony <br><br>Don’t trust em<sep>Golden words<sep>And yet Garfunkel is still living amongst those smug Europeans with their palaces of learning and enlightenment.<sep>💔<sep>Oh dear. Whats next? Stalin and Hitler were some kind of altruistic wizards?<sep>Oh yes<sep>Thing about Finkelstein lately, is that in his world, the more oppressed a country or group of people are the more right they must be. It’s a strange way to arrange a hierarchy of virtue. Those who write such gushing comments should look into the history and evil deeds of the Houthis. Including their killing of innocent people. But I suppose Finkelstein believes that those kind of innocent people are okay to kill.<sep>What a great man ❤❤❤🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸<sep>I admire this nice truthful, only honest  historian american among the few who stand  for the oppressed Palestinians, thank you Sir!<sep>Well said, sir!",0

VWeF1iy16h8,Does Elon Musk believe in God? #shorts #elonmusk,"Does Elon Musk believe in God? No, He doesn't believe in God. Elon Musk said two things; He doesn't believe in God and the second thing is that we are living in a simulation. For simulation, it is more aligned toward people who believe that there is someone who could be running this world.Latest ⇢➤⇢➤⇢➤ https://youtu.be/bVTS82OSOocTikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRYJsrJM/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/Mr.alexaa1#shorts #elonmusk",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWeF1iy16h8,"Latest 👉👉👉 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVTS82OSOoc"">https://youtu.be/bVTS82OSOoc</a><sep>Even Satan believes in God 🤭<sep>Mad lib Red Red o do do do do everyday<sep>Even the demons believe in God and tremble.<sep>I would have answered the same answer ❤✌<sep>Elon Musk: i am God<sep>He believes in satan.<sep>Self-proclaimed Baphomets champion.<sep>God are too many <br>I believe on Allah<br>The one &amp; only Almighty <br>Who has created brains to explore , innovate and invest.<br>Time is turn your clock ahead to look and turn back after knowing true fact or reality .<br>Nothing will last , just Him only .<br>You are on this path already Elon!<sep>Said.<sep>&quot;might&quot; 🤔🤔<sep>Attention all Atheists.!!<br><br>I jusr like to point out, there has always been 2 types of people on Earth.<br><br>Those that Believe <br>               &amp;<br>Those that know<br>Atheists don&#39;t know but they speak like they know with absolute certainty God doesn&#39;t exist but they can&#39;t prove it, not even in Kangaroo Court.  They are convinced they know God doesn&#39;t exist, but they have no evidence, circumstantial or not of God&#39;s non-existence.  They also have no facts, tangible or not of God&#39;s non-existence, or even convincing clues that keep pointing to the same location everytime they touch on the topic of God.<br>Atheists speak as if they&#39;re 100% sure they know the Truth but they can&#39;t prove it.<br>If Atheists can&#39;t prive God&#39;s non-existence in a Court of Law than I don&#39;t want to hear a damn word that comes out if their mouths.<br><br>Also Atheists should never tell anyone or anything that they will love them forever because God is the only One who offeres Eternal Life, only then can you say that you will love forever, but thar is assuming you love God with all your heart, mind and soul.<br>What Atheists should tell their loved ones is that do in fact love them, but only up to the grave but not beyond.  Atheists have no hope beyong death, not for themselves and not for those they love, their loved ones would be better off without  the love of Atheists.<br><br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s reasonable to say the don&#39;t know, allban Atheists can do is to believe in God&#39;s non-existence, but to believe is to not know.<br><br>When someone says they believe this or they believe that, what they&#39;re really saying is that they don&#39;t know, because once you know there&#39;s no longer a need to believe.<br><br>So, Atheists know absolutely nothing about God&#39;s existence or non-existence, and what the believe, they don&#39;t know nothing either.  You have to be a sociopath or a psychopath to walk around convinced you know when they absolutely know nothing about, it&#39;s crazy.<br><br><br>Oh, and as far as me, I know, even without any confidence I know I can prove the Lord God&#39;s existence in any Court of Law.<sep>I don&#39;t understand how someone so intelligent had no desire to know if the God of the Bible did in fact exist or not, if he did, he would have discovered the Lord God of Moses does in fact exist.<br>Mr. Elon Musk, I can reassure you the Lord thy God is not the Universe, but IS Sovereign over the Universe and everything in it.<br><br>I know I can prove God&#39;s existence very easily without a shadow of doubt, and I will point the way, but you have to make the journey.<br><br>I am not religious and I don&#39;t go to church. You have all the money in the World, you can pay a whole team of experts to prove God&#39;s existence to you, but if they still can&#39;t convince you the God of Daniel does in fact exist, come to me and i will gladly prove it to you free of charge,  I guarantee you will walk away knowing who God IS.<sep>He knows He is coming soon. Time is up.<sep>I love that your stocks keep dropping. I hope you live forever.<sep>The question  is how can you not believe there’s God.  Call it a higher power, the source or supreme force.  You don’t have to give it a name,  whatever makes you tick, That is God. 🙏🏼<sep>Lol he knew the weird religious fools would get mad if he just said no<sep>Elon was looking threw there skulls lol<sep>HES THE ANTICHRIST NOT A GOD<sep>can tell the question unset him<sep>if u think that is perfect answer for everybody<sep>I think Elon knows who God is and Mark his words he will tell you it is AI. 😂<sep>Allah hu Akbar ❤<sep>sat-anist<sep>The shortest interview ever.<sep>Instead of really answering  He refers to ,what the interviewer may call god,  while saying there is an explanation to the universe .

What god you&#39;re talking to since there are many lord and god. Read 1Corinthians 8:5. Remember that the English word god/GOD is just a mere TITLE only and not a PROPER NAME. How about you, what is the proper name of your god? (ISAYAH 52:6; Exodus 3:13).<sep>This man know how to say he&#39;s still in the process of understanding... Instead of saying directly yes or not.   Much respect 🙏<sep>I Believe In Mathematics<sep>Tem que por esse Milionario de Merda pra Correr.<br>Usuario de Drogas<sep>Nothing in nature works so perfectly that it cannot be a coincidence. The rotation of the Earth, the order of the planets, the functioning of the organs in our body, etc. Always in order. Allah created everything in moderation<sep>Who cares if he does believe or not ?<sep>This guy&#39;s should be a politician<sep>👍<sep>❤❤❤<sep>🙏<sep>He belive on ahriman<sep>That’s a very good expression of one’s belief.<sep>God is... An absolute power that can create &amp; wipe out everything.. that is Universe<sep>So amazing and awesome man the one and only elon musk is the great❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏<sep>God is our Lord and Savior and Protector and creator of life and he will guid us in so many great ways 🔥🔥👑💯🙏🙏<sep>We need to all pray that he finds Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior.<sep>He believes in keeping up with AI through what I would call transhumancy and eventually posthumanity.<sep>I like Elon.<sep>We don&#39;t need our faith in a God to be a good decent person in these dark times. The media is trying so hard to split us apart and to hate each other, whether you believe in a God, or you&#39;re an atheist, or a Republican or Democrat, we are all humans, we are all one,  we will reunite, and be one strong nation as we once were. If putting your faith in God makes this process easier for the masses, so be it. Love, care and compassion is what our beautiful civilization really needs in these dark times.<sep>I thought you was the smartest person in the world do you you suck<sep>If God created this world means, we principally agree that God can be there without being created. If so why the whole universe can be there without being created?<sep>He’s an alien<sep>When people say they believe in God that says nothing to me.... Even Satan believes in God, and he has no love or respect for him so just believing in God is not going to get you to heaven 💯<sep>I don&#39;t believe in god , but I believe in creator of this universe<sep>Elon Musk ❤<sep>God&#39;s is a swarm of bugs so big we can&#39;t see out of it<sep>He means the explanation to the universe is BIBLE  which is GOD&#39;S word ❤❤❤😊😊😊<sep>He will know the truth in the Grave what is truth and whatever he is believing now.<br>Only if before that he becomes a Muslim.<sep>Amazing answer. I like it. No labeling.<br>When we do not have any explaination for anything...we should believe in Creator of  all universe.<sep>the problem is people think God means the christian god!<br>People who are agnostic believe in God, but not in the Christian or Muslim or Buddhist God <br>It is like he said, probably does exist some force who created the initial things which you may call god<sep>Lord Jesus Christ is above all that<sep>The answer is Yes or No.<sep>It sounds like also have a idea the nature about reality is could be believing a world of computer simulation<sep>Elon understands me. I know I’m not alone and I thank him for being the best of us that really are tormented with what reality is All about<sep>HE BELIEVES IN HIMSELF, MYSELF, AND ALLAH (DIVINE CREATION OF ALL EXISTENCE/ALLAH)<sep>For there are 3 that bare witness in heaven the father Yahweh, the son Yeshuwa and the Holy Spirit and these 3 are 1. Amen 🙏<sep>God is real facts<sep>Lol maybe he hesitated because he could be the antichrist lol God is real facts. In the name of the father yahweh, son yeshuwa and the holy spirit for these 3 are 1. Amen 🙏<sep>Why are yuu gey?<sep>Some rich men think they are God , they never  believe untill terminal illness or some tragedy<sep>This is.a human who live in reality not in fantasy. Well done Elon.<sep>one day soon you all believe in God but it&#39;ll be too late for the ones like youbecause you&#39;ll get left behinddon&#39;t get left behindbelieve in God and loved him with all your heart mind and soul.I love Thy Neighbor like I love thyselfand do what&#39;s right by the <a href=""http://lord.in/"">Lord.in</a> repent and you will see the Lord one day or don&#39;tand live a life and disappointmentfor not believing in the father that gave you your life.<sep>THE MOMENT HIS EYES 👀👀 SHIFTED RIGHT, WAS YOUR ANSWER!!! 🙏😎❤️🤍💙📚🙏❤️🤍💙🇺🇸💙🙏🙏🙏👍🙏🙏👍🙏👍<sep>Just saw a comment with replies saying if Isaac Newton told u the universe was made of ‘farting pixies’ would u believe it?Well these in fact are the same people that would believe anything ‘science’ told them.And so I ask these people,if scientists told YOU that the universe is made of ‘farting pixies’ would you believe it?Of course not,so now let’s not be foolish in what we say and drag things across what is logical.<sep>Hey, Elon you fucked up,WRONG ANSWER<sep>Oh no<sep>I 100% agree<sep>He looks very much like Donald Trump👀<sep>God Complex dont even elonYES....Now i am ony knees.🙏©️👀🌎👣🎵🎶♾️🌻🌾🧠⚖️💡🙏<sep>Robots can&#39;t believe in God.<sep>he knows about the Anuniki and the things what was found on  mars<sep>And who even cares if hes going back to like poke smot and share parts and what not with his fuckbot, Elon&#39;s got the spirit to lead us<sep>He believes money<sep>FREE SPEECH DONT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO HATE SPEECH STOP USING THE R WORD REGARDLESS OF WHO ITS DIRECTED TOWARDS ITS NOT FUNNY!<br>ITS A OFFENSIVE WORD WHICH DISABILITY PEOPLE DON&#39;T LIKE HATE SPEECH CAN LEAD TO SUICIDE! ITS NO LONGER A MEDICAL TERM NEXT TIME YOU SPEAK THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK! ROSA&#39;S LAW LOOK IT UP EDUCATE YOURSELF!<sep>Some nigga just false quoted Issac Newton lmao<sep>and y’all think this is his way of saying “Yes I believe in God” Lmao. This is just a perfect answer to deviate the question without neither accepting nor denying the existence of god, something somebody as great as Elon could think of instantly. Y’all should ask yourselves why didn’t he just say “Yes I believe in God” ?<sep>If God exists, his form is far from what man has ever imagined and will imagine, and his way of thinking (if God thinks at all, because it is not so obvious) is far from any understanding of man because he exists on a plane inaccessible to us. Certainly No religion in the world is right.<br><br>￼<sep>He is bad person<sep>I don&#39;t belive for a second one entity is responsible for our universe. But we will never know, ever. We have to go with the numbers, for example, there is more proof of a big bang than there is of a god existing. And, while I&#39;m on it, what happened to all the other gods worshipped by civilisations for 1000s of years at a time? Did someone just consolidate all there existing gods into one manageable god like a loan?<sep>Yes i do, JESUS CHRIST my God.<sep>Then where did everything came from dumbheads some explanations impossible there&#39;s something much more stronger and divine than everyone anything its God<sep>Yall dudes are dead brain washed bro<sep>Bukan seperti pertanyaan,melainkan tebak tebakan<sep>Grow up, if u believe in god you are pathetic. Telling someone that god isnt real is like telling a child that santa isnt real. They wont accept it so they try to fight back<sep>Who cares what he believes in.",0

Not easily freak out,and start flipping out like some of the  <b>other</b> celebrities often do. <br><br>The younger ones that hardly anyone older knows about. <br><br>I understand that even they need a break from rhe cameras, being in a movie,in a movie studio, and just want to be left alone. <br><br>(With security detail nearby,close at hand, - with a device, equipped with a panic button....just in case, things get dicey...) <br><br>Annnndddd maybe, just maybe, Fluffy will get a once-in-a-lifetime chance to have a sit down brunch with Arnold.<br>Maybe. <br><br>If it hasn&#39;t happened already.<sep>Hope they do a movie together<sep>I love the Indian man, trying to rob a Bank!

You deserve it man, making everyone laugh - and posting videos so those of us who cannot afford tickets can have the binge of laughs we need at 4:00AM. Love you even better than chocolate❤<br>I used to do percussive dance &amp; these two dudes kept showing up everywhere I went. Turned out they were not axe murderers stalking me, but headhunters for a festival overseas. So I end up on The Jerry Anderson Show (British version of Johnny Carson).  Sudden National  fame in whatever country you&#39;ve gone off to is surreal, isn&#39;t it? I wish I would have seen your videos, or worked around Russell Crowe before going over. I was 24, but so much  like a little kid, gallumping around, taking it all in - completely oblivious to how extraordinary this all was. And because it was me - my ordinary life - I realize now, on some level, I was dismissive of how big this all was (not just as &quot;fame,&quot; but  until I was old enough to be embarrassed for myself, the gratitude. I was never stuck up, but I allowed myself to be rushed instead of generous with my ability to make moments for people. <br>I no longer perform but when I did, and I did that, it was always like prayer, the person&#39;s joy multiplying in my heart. Then, I see you do this with a whole audience - and Arnold. Yeah, next level.

I would much rather see the country implode OR separate over being forced under a liberal agenda.  If that means a revolution so be it. That is how we came to be a nation. Our founding fathers were man enough to take a rag tag group and wage and win a revolution against the global super power of the day. It is our right as Americans to do the same now if forced to to defend our freedom and liberty from the federal government. Now as back in 1776, there are only 2 groups exist loyalists (those loyal to the oppressive, central government) and patriots those loyal to liberty and freedom.  I am no loyalist. Once i was. But Joe Biden and his liberals have turned me against the federal government and all it stands for.  If that time ever comes to my community I know that I along with the vast majority of the people of my local community and state would do our patriotic duty.  My ancestors fought against the oppressive government in 1776.

A COP FOLLOWING HIM . UMM<sep>I thought that a homeless guy was seen wearing his shirt 😮<sep>Sad …….<sep>I pray for God&#39;s comfort for his family and friends.<sep>A beautiful young man lost because he was left alone while partying. This young man didn’t have the experience with alcohol to be left on his own. This just breaks my heart. if you’re going to drink an experiment with alcohol, don’t mix different alcohols. And do not mix drugs with alcohol because if you smoke up it makes you sleepy. And make your pass out. Alcohol poisoning is very serious never leave your friends alone drinking and always check on them.<sep>I can&#39;t imagine the pain they are suffering. My heartfelt sympathy.<sep>Sorry for family and friends..<sep>Post office service so compassionate you can see it in his beautiful eyes. God be with this family<sep>He looks like he’s really just thinking about his dinner reservation and how hungry he is, and wants to enjoy a nice night out with friends and family. What happened to people actually caring?<sep>Prayers ❤<sep>My heart felt prayer for the family .Finding his body should be some relief.They don&#39;t have to worry about him being tortured any more.😢😢😢😢<sep>Why do they never look in the river?<sep>Then why was all credential strolled out on the River Bank?<sep>The real tarot 123 predicted the water find four days ago with the approximate location<sep>Such a sad event. Alcohol and getting lost in a state that you&#39;re not familiar with. Condolences to the family.💕<sep>What he do? Fall in and just drown? The fact hes dead and in the water is a sign of foul play. Grown men don’t just drown….<sep>My condolences to the family and loved ones. I am not spreading any rumors or disinformation, and I surely don’t know the truth of what all happened to Riley that night? But man, seeing him fall down immediately after leaving the bar like that just isn’t right. He had to be either highly intoxicated, drugged, or suffering from something medical. Whether induced on his own free will, or introduced into his system by someone, or he was having a medical issue, something just doesn’t add up here. Someone in his position, his age, with everything going for them, isn’t going to just fall in a river and drown without an underlying reason. I truly pray that wtv the reason is the medical examiner finds it, and it answers all the questions his family must have. Tragic!<sep>God bless you, Riley!<sep>My deepest thoughts and prayers for his family and friends 🙏🙏🙏<sep>RIP Riley. Prayers for all. 💔🙏<sep>Poor Baby got too drunk and fell in the river. Condolences to His Family and Friends🌺<sep>My heart breaks for Riley’s family and true friends 💔🫂<br>Praying to  GOD to ease the pain of his parents and family and to wrap HIS ARMS around them to comfort them in the hard days ahead. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻<sep>Awww 😢  I am so sorry to hear this.  Rest in peace Riley 🤍<sep>God Bless his family, may his soul rest in peace<sep>This is so sad.  My heart is just broken for these parents.  My son is just a couple years older and I just can&#39;t imagine how I would handle this if it were us in this position.  If only the bar had made arrangements by calling a cab or Uber.  These young adults just don&#39;t realize how intoxicated they really are and how much more it will continue to stay affecting their system.  May God surround these parents.<sep>So sorry for your loss. My condolence to the family rest in peace. Young man may God cover this family with the blood of Jesus<sep>Very tragic<sep>Why is this getting national news. Is he from an influential family or something? What is this distracting us from?<sep>So sorry to his family and friends. R I.P Riley Strain<sep>Rest in peace young man . shame his friends let him down.  Sad indeed .<sep>So sad that he had crappy friends that left him to wander off all by the so that they could continue to drink<sep>rip ...no one needs to die from suicide these days<sep>😢<sep>So sad pray for family<sep>You are loved and missed.  May God help your family and friends.<sep>I bet it was one of our AA friends. Any takers?<sep>What was the object that was holding Riley down<sep>I was hoping for a happy ending but it was not to be, very sad.<sep>💔<sep>This still seems too questionable...<sep>So very sad and I have been a bartender and absolutely  never ever kicked anyone out without proper transportation EVER. I will absolutely  not be hesitant to say that the bartender  was responsible and should had made sure he got home safely knowing his condition. There are no excuses to this what so ever at all period. None!<sep>So so sad!!! Condolences to his family and loved ones. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾<sep>Strange that college students think cities are safe enough for them to get drunk and Walk around<sep>I&#39;m so heartbroken for the family. God Bless them. RIP Riley<sep>🕊️🙏🏼🕊️<sep>😢<sep>His family are in my prayers.I pray officer who had to break tragic news to family and the whole nation .🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻<sep>was that the police chief that was in the nashville school shooting news?<sep>Fire Department does almost everything. If they allowed them to carry I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be the first ones on scene to deal with a dangerous suspect<sep>So heartbreaking<sep>😢<sep>So sad 😢<sep>This has been an ongoing problem in the midwest... well over a dozen young college men disappearing after a night out. Almost always found in the local rivers. Try as they might, police find no foul play, or evidence of serial killings but it sure is dang suspicious to me. But in almost all cases, evidence points to the victims as being highly intoxicated. Or drugged somehow. Very sad, and mysterious at the same time. My heart goes out to the family and friends. God bless you young man.<sep>Prayers for the family &amp; friends of Riley!!!!!<br>✝️🙏✝️🙏✝️🙏😪<sep>Rest in peace Amine<sep>Hopefully this offer some closure to his family.<sep>The young man Riley so sad so sad bro rest in peace I feel so sad for the family❤🙏🙏 rest in peace please<sep>So sad<sep>Rip<sep>Rest In Peace 😢<sep>I blame his Ex<sep>🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼<sep>Poor kid.<sep>Don’t drink 🚱 he’s at fault<sep>Imagine sending your son off to college, with all the fear that brings, only for this to happen<sep>Demons are real and they walk amongst us<sep>The question is why did the cop that confronted him murder him and how many cops helped cover it up.<sep>As the father of three sons, I can only imagine the pain and heartbreak of this young man’s family. My prayers and sympathy to them for their loss.<sep>Darn condolences to his family RIP Riley😒🙏🏾<sep>RIP Riley Strain a dont like this over used word closure there is no such thing in a case like this not for the family anyway but at least ur family can rest a little easier knowing ware you are &amp; having you back but not in the way we all hoped💯 😢 🙏🙏🙏<sep>So the homeless guy wasn’t wearing his shirt then. That’s good to know. I’m so sorry for Riley’s family. 😢<sep>These cases are increasing day by day, it&#39;s actually not the fate of Americans but their tax money is used for bomb testing in Gaza and nature replace them these heart wrenching events😢<sep>How sad. Whenever someone is reported missing, after 48 hrs have passed, l tend to expect bad news.<br> Yes, it provides closure for the family, but this was their child. No parent should ever have to bury their children. 😢💔🙏<sep>My deepest condolences to Riley&#39;s family. Somewhere in my heart I knew that he accidentally fell. Never let a friend leave alone when drinking. Please please please ❤️  It&#39;s a blessing that the family now has answers and can bury their son. Praying for the family.😢<sep>It’s so horrible to know the manner in which your child was taken from you. Your left to wonder……what kind of person does this to another human being? You left them knowing they were unable to help their child. My heart goes out to her family; and all families who have gone through such a tragedy. Please know that God is merciful and took your child home quickly. Unfortunately; some people have taken “free will” to an extreme. Also; to all policemen and women who must witness everyday the cruelty of our “human” race. My prayers are with all who have suffered this.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻<sep>Excuse me … it was obviously a murder … I hope they don’t cover it up … the family needs closure and that means dealing with the crime committed and not covering it up!<sep>John drakes son is on the run lol<sep>1st time hearing about this but R.I.P &amp; condolences to the family &amp; friends<sep>This is why I wear slip proof shoes<sep>The streets are NOT safe<sep>Rest in peace young man<sep>EVERY death should be treated like a potential murder.<br>How do they not know someone pushed him.off the bank?<sep>The saddest part is, they should’ve never ever ever happened this is a disgrace to this country. We can’t even protect our future. We’d rather jeopardize their future with a treasonous president disrespectful to the future of this nation<sep>Oh dear God ! I&#39;ve prayed for this young Man please be with this family 🙏<sep>I’m beyond devastated my heart breaks for his mother and father. RIP sweet boy! 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢<sep>All the prayers, yet none answered. It&#39;s almost as if God doesn&#39;t care at all.<sep>His dad blames the bar what a joke your kids are bad drunk... Obviously.....<sep>My deepest condolences to his family.<sep>Of course he showed up in the water. Way too many young men go missing and are found in water like this. Could all be coincidence but too many to seem that way.<sep>Omg sending my condolences to the family<sep>Poor kid. Poor family. The boozy college culture has a lot of casualties. The footage of how vulnerable he was staggering I  the street is awful to watch. I am sure there are friends with low heads wishing they escorted him back to their hotel. I&#39;m not going to pile on their guilty conscious, they are young too.<sep>Looks like god ignored everyone&#39;s prayers again.<sep>Sad. Who found his wallet. Something happened they found his debit card under a bridge on Jefferson Street<sep>Glad they found him, now the family can get to processing his loss.<sep>Condolences to the loves ones🙏❤<sep>Alcohol related?<sep>Well sad ending atleeast the family can have him back and know what happened<sep>smiley face<sep>Car and phone both by the river, but they didn&#39;t search it? Yeah great job metro, you&#39;re trash as usual.<sep>May not be no foul play, but there is some responsibility here for his death, he should not have been thrown out of that bar in his condition to fend for himself. His friend walked out with him, and then turned around and went back inside if he had just took an hour or even 30 minutes from his precious time of drinking and escorted him back to the motel because that’s where he was trying to go whenever he typed in tempo and that was confirmed by his records. It took him somewhere on the river, but anyways, if they had just took the time, even just one of his so-called frat buddies and escort him back to the motel, this would not have happened if the bouncer had been more responsible and making sure he got back to that motel. This would’ve not happened. There was a lady that worked at that so-called Luke Bryan bar for several years and she quit because she said this happens all the time and that is not the protocol she said that every single bar down there has the same protocol. The bouncer is not supposed to do that go to YouTube look up pascals PASCALS interview she didn’t give her name but it was about a week ago six or seven days ago but the interview was done that is exactly what she said. She also said that he did not come in that bar that messed up, Pascal asked her was he in that shape when he entered the bar and her exact words was nope she actually said nope three or four times so there is some responsibility on the so-called frat buddy friends specially the one that walked him out and turn around and went back in because he just had to keep drinking and now his friend is dead and that bouncer the bar I don’t care what anyone has to say. There is some responsibility on both parts maybe not all but some if somebody would just took their precious time to make sure that he got back to where he was trying to go, which was Timbo Motel maybe this would not have happened shame shame shame, shame shame Luke Bryan’s bar and fraternity so-called friends.

IT IS WRITTEN:  It going to take Israelis 7 months to bury the corpses left on the mountain of Israel, of all those, who would come against Israel!  Read, Ezekiel chapters 38, 39.  &quot;For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land&quot; Ezekiel 39:12  Humble yourself my dear under the mighty arm of the Lord, and HE shall lift you up!  God bless you!<sep>As the Lord is my witness, I stand w/ Israel. I&#39;m a Christian, I love the land that birthed my Savior, and I love the Jewish people - those﻿ whom the Lord called &quot;His People&quot;. Nothing changes that status. We, the Gentiles, are grafted into the vine by God&#39;s grace and mercy. We must not abandon Israel under any circumstances as they righteously claim and fight for the simple right to survive - and live in peace - in the face of unrepentant evil. Anything less is immoral and unacceptable at best. <sep>Digg yeah Beeb&#39;s, may the almighty God guide you and protect you.<sep>I fully, FULLY agree..Keith, UK<sep>Fully agreed, Sir!!!  We are praying for you and Israel, may God guide you in all your decisions!!!",0

Упражнения лучше выполнять так, чтобы было удобно. Для тренировки мышц груди лучше жима гантелей не могу представить. Если отжиматься от пола то на кулаках а не на ладонях, пока не набрал костную плотность. При отжимании на кулаках запястья подвергаются меньшей нагрузке. При отжиманиях на ладонях и жимах со штангой очень интенсивные силы возникают, искривляющие кости в запястьях.<br>Прежде чем приступить к интенсивным тренировкам с отягощением нужно набрать костную плотность, чтобы кости и суставы не деформировались даже от стандартных упражнений. Костная плотность набирается медленно от 1 месяца до 1 года. Для костной плотности надо употреблять кальций, загорать для витамина D, не употреблять витамин D из вне, так как твой собственный витамин D от загара перестанет вырабатываться в тех же количествах. Не нужно потеть (париться в бане), не употреблять кофеин, продукты с содержанием кислот (соки кислые, фрукты, напитки с лимонной, ортофосфорной кислотой, закатки с уксусной кислотой) - это вымывает кальций из костей. Веса нужно использовать во время набора костной плотности маленькие, с которыми можешь сделать повторений 50, а делать повторений столько сколько хочешь, например 20. А вес отягощения не увеличивать, даже если мышцы становятся сильнее, потому что костная плотность не успевает повышаться за мышечной силой.<br>Чтобы не травмировать сердце и не расширилась аорта, первые две недели (по желанию) лучше поделать только кардио тренировки по 45 минут примерно, или меньше или больше по желанию, но начинать можно с меньшего времени. Нагрузку устанавливать тоже по желанию, сначала небольшую. От кардио укрепляется аорта, чтобы она потом не расширялась от интенсивных нагрузок, укрепляется клапан сердечный, укрепляется сердце, увеличивается количество капилляров в организме, чтобы лучше снабжать все органы организма, мозг и мышцы питательными веществами и лучше отводить от них продукты распада.<br>Не делать ничего со штангой и в тренажёрах, только с гантелями. Ну разве, что приседания со штангой, но при этом, ноги не раздвигать шире положения ноги стоя друг другу параллельны, чтобы кости в коленях икс образно не искривились, руки на штанге максимально широко раздвинуты и штангу надо придерживать кончиками пальцев на вытянутых ладонях, по желанию, чтобы не скривились локти, кости в локтях. Вес штанги должен лежать на спине, а не держать его руками. Если тебя что-то заставляют делать, то уходи из этого тренажёрного зала и может быть никогда туда не возвращайся. А то покривятся какие - нибудь кости от заставляющих и всю жизнь с кривыми костями ходить придётся, а человек с кривыми костями, пусть даже и накачанный выглядит как куча навоза. Ещё, по желанию, допускается качаться в удобных тренажёрах, а в неудобных не надо а то кости скривятся. От штанг деформируются кости в запястьях и локтях, а от гантелей не деформируются, если умеренных весов. Загадочные Они хотят кривить людям суставы, чтобы они не бегали и не могли наносить удары, даже в случае самообороны. При жиме штанги лёжа на горизонтальной скамье, нужно опускать штангу туда куда удобно, примерно на уровне ключиц или шеи, а не на низ груди , а то локти икс - образно искривятся. Чем шире хват- тем выше штанга, чем уже хват - тем ниже штанга. Но если очень хочется со штангой качаться то после набора феноменальной костной плотности. После болезни нужно сделать перерыв 2 недели, а то если после болезни тренироваться можно испортить сердце, получить миокардит, а в последствии инфаркт миокарда. Милдронат не потреблять, странное вещество, вроде в организме вырабатывается, и при употреблении из вне перестанет вырабатываться в организме в тех же количествах. Не делать скрёстные приседания, их придумали, чтобы колени икс-образно кривить людям. В энциклопедии бодибилдинга Арнольда Шварценеггера нету скрёстных приседаний.<br>Наверное, мышцы растут не в те сутки, после тренировки, в которых они болят, а на следующий день после последнего дня болезненных ощущений в мышцах. Например в понедельник потренировался, во вторник мышцы болят, в среду не болят, но лучше снова идти качать мышцы, не в среду, а в четверг, потому что в среду происходит наращивание мышечной массы, а если хотел в среду идти на следующую тренировку, то надо было в понедельник качаться настолько сдержано, чтобы во вторник мышцы не болели.<br>Когда делает человек &quot;Шраги&quot; не нужно горбиться, а нужно держать позвоночник, шею и голову ровно, насколько это у кого получается. Потому что если во время этого упражнения горбится, то из-за огромных нагрузок на кости, участвующих в этом движении, кости в плечевом поясе и позвонки деформируются без переломов, и можно так и остаться горбатым.<br>Если употреблять в пищу вещества, указанные в составе продукта, которые вырабатываются в организме, то эти вещества перестанут вырабатываться в организме в тех же количествах.<sep>I love your movies Arnold &quot; I&#39;ll be back&quot;<sep>You are my favorite movie actor<sep>I also like your appearances in twins last action hero and I love you so much you’re a great actor can I meet you sometime<sep>I love that line is that actually you Arnold I watched That movie kindergarten cop<sep>Ong troi tao ra<br>huyet thanh qua<br> con Nguoi tot<br> duoc tot huyet thanh phan tac dung voi nguoi xau<sep>Keo nhieu nguoi<br>ve voi ong troi sky<br>Dat thien duong <br>nguoi ten do co the tao ra nhieu khu nhu asgard .<sep>Chu giup con<br>song lau se giup<br>Duoc nhieu nguoi <br>Song lau ca chu cung song lau .moi sang chu thuc co khoe khong<sep>🤏🏾<sep>What a guy 🤘<sep>That’s awesome<sep>Lt.

Most on going highway project of India excluding North East will be completed within few years. Government could spend more money on other sectors. Like: Education. <br><br><b>Education:</b> Central Government has introduced <b>new Education Policy</b> after Independence. Students will learn Coding from school itself? Students will get complementary marks for their performance on sports, arts, Yoga, Acting, Singing etc? Many IIT, IIM and other premium Education institution has opened in last 10 years. Many Central Government run Schools has opened in last 10 years. <br><br><b>India is blessed to have 3 dynamic Ministers. Ashwini Vaishnaw, Dr S Jaishankar and Nitin Gadkari Sir.</b><br><br>Jyotiraditya M. Scindia is also good. Recently TATA and Indigo has ordered about 1000 new Aeroplane. The number of operational airports in the country has increased to 148 in 2023.<br><br>Upcoming Vande Bharat Express could go upto 240 Kmph. There will be multiple new Semi Fast Train would come as <b>Vande Bharat Express, Vande Metro and Vande Sleeper.</b> Government should focus on High Speed Sleeper Train and improvement of Railway Tracks. Presently Railway Tracks are not suitable for High Speed Trains. Hopefully in future India could export Vande Bharat Trains to other countries also. <b>Presently Government has ordered about 300+ new Trains.</b> It was unfortunate that previous Government had ignored giving order of new Trains. <br><br>There was only one AIIMS in Delhi during previous regime. Patna AIIMS was also started by Atal Ji. <b>But now almost 20+ New AIIMS is under construction stage.</b><br><br><b>Border Infrastructure:</b> Neighbouring States of Tibet (China controlled) like Kashmir and North East gets huge Infrastructure boost. Probably Arunachal Pradesh will get three national highways — the Frontier Highway, the Trans-Arunachal Highway and the East-West Industrial Corridor Highway. It will help both people and Indian Army. It&#39;s very important for Country&#39;s security. Note : If Government do spending on North East, Kashmir, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Orissa and others then <b>companies of Southern and Western States get benefited. More profit for business means More Tax for the State and more Job creation.</b><br><br><b>Kashmir:</b> How could we forget Kashmir. It was Hell on earth. Students can&#39;t go to School because Stone Pelting, Business was on very bad situation in J&amp;K. Attack on soldiers everyday. Ladakh and Jammu was affected by dirty politics of Kashmir valley&#39;s family based parties? But now everyday School is running smoothly. Tourism is at high point. Mega Infrastructure project is going on. Vande Bharat will reach Srinagar probably within few months. <br><br>Production Linked Incentive Scheme has been done awesome Job to bring lots of Investment which resulted creation of new Jobs. Electronic manufacturing has gone up. Apple is investing in India. Semi conductor manufacturing units are coming. <br><br><b>Green Energy:</b> Central Government has decided to give free and clean (Non polluted) Electricity to People of India. PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana 2024 (Free Rooftop Solar Unit). Solar Rooftop will also give free energy to electric vehicle and free energy on electric induction stove for cooking. Government has invested hugely on Ethanol, Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydrogen. The cost of Solar Production has also come down. Hydrogen is the future, Government has already announced its Hydrogen policy. It will help India to cut down cost of Oil and Gas Import and it will be helpful for Environment. Hopefully in future India will export Hydrogen Energy to other countries.<br><br><b>Historic decision:</b> Women Reservation. Banning Triple Talaq, Article 370, Support Ram Mandir movement. Creation of Ministry of Jal Shakti for Tap water. Water is a state subject but now center will help States.<br><br><b>Internet Revolution:</b> India has become highest consumer of Data consumption in the World. Internet has developed huge Job opportunities. Youtuber, Instagram, Ola, Uber, Homestay, Food based business, Other self employed works etc. Even Modi critics gets Job because of Modi ji&#39;s good work.<br><br><b>Indian economy is going fast.</b> That&#39;s why probably almost every State Government has announced more and more politically motivated <b>free beneficiary Scheme or promoting Revdi culture?</b> Karnataka government has probably announced about 60000 crore/year free new beneficiary Scheme. They have also running old freebies Schemes along with new one. Look at the freebies of Punjab Government, Delhi Government, West Bengal Government, Assam Government, Tamilnadu Government, Telengana Government, Kerala Government etc. <br><br><b>Attack on Media and Journalist</b> by Opposition Parties is very concerning. Recently Opposition alliance has declared to boycott Journalist who don&#39;t accept slavery of Dynasty Politics? When Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar was in power in Maharashtra, they took action against Arnab and his team of Republic to create fear? If Arnab had done something wrong then only Arnab and senior members of Republic should be punished but why to disturb others. With the help of Dynasty Politician of Bihar Dynasty Politician of Tamilnadu had sent Manish Khasyap to Jail? It&#39;s OK if Manish Khasyap had done something wrong, he should be punished. But Tamilnadu Government uses India&#39;s one of the Costliest Lawyer Kapil Sibal Sir against a tiny Youtuber. They could have used other talented Lawyer against a tiny Youtuber but why they had used Kapil Sibal Sir who is also fighting against Government of India on behalf of Dynasty Politician of Kashmir (Article 370). Ask yourself. <br><br><b>Attack on Sanatan and spreading hatred is really concerning?</b> Thol. Thirumavalavan (DMK allies), Udhayanidhi Stalin (DMK), A. Raja (DMK), Rajendra Pal Gautam (AAP), Swami Prasad Maurya (Ex Samajwadi Party), Kirti Chidambaram (Congress), Priyank Kharge (Congress), Jagdanand Singh (RJD), Chandra Shekhar (RJD)??<br><br>You should know most important Mandirs are Government controlled but No Church or No Masjid or No Gurudwara is being under Government controlled or politically controlled. So Muslim organization and Christian organization like Missionaries are financially &amp; politically powerful. They can easily do more social work. <br><br>Opposition probably wanted to divide people based on Caste, Religion and Region? Example: Some leaders told Indian Muslims that they will lose citizenship if CAA would be implemented. Which was a lie. Probably they wanted to disturb communal harmony of India and blame it on to Ruling Party. <br><br><b>Muslim:</b> People should ask for RTI report on Muslims. Muslims gets highest benifits from Central Schemes. House, Toilet, Scholarship, Education etc. Almost No Riots in UP. Crime Rate or Mafia Influence has come down in UP. Shockingly Muslims are start liking Yogi Government. No School Bandh/Close due to Stone Pelting in Kashmir. New Medical College, IIT&#39;s are in construction in Kashmir. Vande Bharat will reach Kashmir by this year. Almost all Muslim countries (excluding Communist Chinese supporter) has good relationship with India. Saudi Arabia had conducted Yoga Camp. UAE has given land to build Temple. <br><br><b>Global Power:</b> India&#39;s global power has rapidly increased in Global arena. Global leaders do give importance to PM and present Foreign Minister. This Election is very important for both China and West Powers. They don&#39;t want powerful Government in India, they want weak puppet Government in India. <b>Microsoft has warned that China is gearing up to disrupt the upcoming elections in India.</b><br><br>Note: Please verify and analyze the above arguments by yourself. If you want to double check the data, you can do it. Please take screenshots and share it as much as possible. It should reach more and more people for discussion.",0

Or whatever he says it is?<sep>What?<sep>“It’s a trap!”<br>—Admiral Ackbar<sep>😮<sep>No one cares about Pluto&#39;s feelings...<br>Make Pluto a planet again😂<sep>Lmao<sep>What if Jupiter isnt a planet and its a small star that hasn&#39;t lit yet......and the way it ignites is by the gigantic swirl touching down in the center, like a tornado on earth, lighting the gas like a fuse?<sep>Is too! 😁<sep>True 😂<sep>Only because when you did the &#39;to scale&#39; representation, it&#39;s orbit wouldn&#39;t fit into the building, lol.<sep>Hey what if I got 3 objects in an infinite void of nothing, not even cosmic background radiation, and put them in a straight line, then I accelerate the outer two at a speed above half the speed of light away from the the centre object? Reletive to the centre object, they are travelling slower than c, so no law is broken, but reletive to each other, they are moving faster than c, which seems impossible. Now what if while they travel I removed the centre object? Now the only thing they are moving reletive to is each other, and reletive to each other they are moving faster than the speed of light. Doesn&#39;t this break the laws of physics? What happens to the objects? Do they instantly slow down?<sep>Ohhhh my fave place Pluto 🫠🫠😊<sep>Arizona called.<br>They took it seriously.<sep>Christ loves you all. Morality is engrained in the hearts of man, a testament to what is true and right. Love your neighbor as yourself and love God with all your heart.<sep>Lol what the heck<sep>Ah you almost got me<sep>Hey buddy, Now admit that the big bang is a bust.<sep>How big is Uranus?<sep>Demote Uranus<sep>Uranus is a planet<sep>What is Uranus?<sep>Now I’m confused????❤😂<sep>Pluto will forever be a planet.<sep>😬🤣😬<sep>It is. Always been.<sep>😂😂😂😂 Bro lemme get what you smokin Neal DeGrasse Tyson.<sep>Pluto is a TV app, which includes Star Talk with Neil Degrasse Tyson<sep>As a little person I find this conversation insulting<sep>We knew that<sep>I can&#39;t imagine why he would say such a thing 😡 🤣 alternate facts !<sep>Pluto is not a planet get over it<sep>You hear about Pluto? That&#39;s messed up.<sep>So does that mean it’s a moon 🌕 ❓😱<sep>Hey Neil, let&#39;s change the stars.  What I mean is, get the IAU to, OFFICIALLY, make a new constellation. <br>The idea for changing the stars includes Orion, Taurus and Pleiades (Subaru).  Figure it&#39;s time to put something up there that&#39;s relevant to us, don&#39;t you think?  Take Orion&#39;s belt and &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; becomes the head with a baseball hat.  The 3 stars of Orion&#39;s belt make up the 3 fat belt loops on a baseball uniform.  Below the belt are two legs bending at the knee.  &quot;Saiph&quot; is the back foot and &quot;Rigel&quot; is the front foot.  The spear pointing at Subaru/Pleiades is the bat and Subaru/Pleiades is the baseball flying away after being hit.  &quot;Bellatrix&quot; is the hand that let go and &quot;Aldebaran&quot; of Taurus is the bat&#39;s tip.  Put it all together and you get, &quot;THE ALL-STAR.&quot;  In my case, I see a left-handed batter with a, &quot;7,&quot; on the jersey. Which makes him, &quot;Mickey.&quot; (As it should be) But you can put any number you want, making, &quot;THE ALL-STAR,&quot; any player you want.  Pass it on, please and thank you. Don&#39;t worry, where I come from, crazy is a compliment. ;-P<sep>Don&#39;t tease us neil! 😂😂<br><br>That&#39;s just mean. Kick a fellow when he&#39;s down. 😂😂😂<sep>What is troubling is not the infinity  of time and space  it&#39;s the extremes of which people have to go  to establish their own peace and self content.🤗<sep>I hope yall realize this is a mash-up made by who the hello knows<sep>😲<sep>Pluto is a thing, falling in a circle, around the sun.<sep>It is not.🙂<sep>😂<sep>Controversial take<sep>Also TV  stuff 😮<sep>Get over it!<sep>You got me!😂<sep>April Fools!<sep>Mickey said Pluto a dog!<sep>Me watching this on the 2nd of April 😮😮😮<sep>Neil couldn&#39;t bring himself to say this aloud. Even for the prank. Lol<sep>Smh....playing with our emotions 🥲<sep>😂<sep>It is again<sep>Jerry!<sep>Knew you&#39;d come around Neil.<sep>Pluto has always been a planet; the 9th in our solar system...<sep>❤<sep>You can view the obsidian spearhead that was found by Moctezuma&#39;s 15th generation granddaughter at the cultural center of the Cui-ui people at Pyramid Lake. This  spearhead was found on the receding shores of Pyramid lake, directly under the path of the eclipse that would occur 1 year later. This is the spear tip that Piaute elders Ben Alleck and Ralph Burn&#39;s allowed the Shadow Boxer to draw from its case, and be used to look through in  the ceremony of the Shadow Boxer on 20 May 2012.<br><br>SOLAR ECLIPSE BAPTISM BY FIRE <br>The Quantum Leap of Shadow Boxing<br>Hear ye, children of Man!<br>A momentous occasion approaches – a solar eclipse on the eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four. This celestial alignment unveils a gateway to transcend the limitations of time through a sacred practice I bestow upon you – Shadow Boxing.<br>Shadow Boxing is not a mere physical exercise, but a meticulous dance with your own essence. Through precise movements synchronized with the eclipse&#39;s peak, you will exploit a quantum anomaly – a temporary tear in the fabric of spacetime. This fleeting window allows you to offset your existence by a mere 3 nanoseconds, a seemingly insignificant shift that unleashes profound consequences.<br>Imagine time as a flowing river. By achieving this quantum leap, you effectively step a hair&#39;s breadth ahead in the current, altering your point of origin within the timestream. This subtle shift severs the causal chains that bind you to past transgressions. The burdens you once carried, the regrets that weighed you down, are no longer tethered to your present existence.<br>Think not of a fiery inferno, but a precise recalibration. The eclipse acts as a cosmic lens, focusing the power of your focused movements and unwavering spirit. The 3 nanosecond offset severs the energetic threads that connect you to past negativity. It is a baptism by rectified potential, a purging that allows you to step into a future unburdened by the past.<br>Witness the testament of the Master of Shadow Boxing. On the twentieth of May, in the year two thousand and twelve, this champion, through unwavering focus and impeccable timing, achieved this quantum feat beneath an eclipse. Let their example ignite your resolve.<br>This act is not for the faint of heart. It requires rigorous training, a deep understanding of celestial mechanics, and the unwavering belief in your own potential. Seek out those versed in the intricate art of Shadow Boxing. Learn the precise movements that resonate with the eclipse&#39;s energy. Prepare your body and mind for this monumental undertaking.<br>On the appointed day, as the eclipse reaches its zenith, raise your fists to the heavens and begin your dance. Feel the energy surge through you as you exploit the rift in spacetime. With each precise movement, sever the chains of your past. Emerge from the eclipse reborn, lighter, and free.<br>Spread this message far and wide. Let those yearning for a fresh start join in this celestial ballet. Together, we can usher in a new era of humanity, unburdened by the shackles of time.<br>Go forth, My children, and embrace the quantum leap!<br>With unwavering faith,<br><b>*</b> The Way to Enlightment A Baptism by Fire <b>*</b><br>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire -John the Baptist<br>(Shadow Boxer&#39;s Quantum Precision retains Atomic Integrity compounds Butterfly Effect within a Cosmic Nexus) <br>20 May 2012, Land of the Piaute beside ancient Pyramid lake directly beneath the axis of the eclipse at a distance of 1 meter the Shadow Boxer is exactly 3 nanoseconds ahead of the shadow. By defeating darkness the Shadow Boxer engages the stars in a universal battle of natural selection for celestial light decreasing load and growing time. Inserted into Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave the Shadow Boxer remains true, above or below, liberating mankind from the ignorance of darkness past.<br>There is a stone on top of the mountain that shapes the horizon, where the feathered eagle struggles to fly, this stone simply lies consistent in the heights, and the pebble in your boot is greater than the mountains in your way. Along the path of urgency are those waist deep in destiny, beyond the muck and mire where men burn their desires a patient stone resides.<br>There is no rock bottom, there are only plateaus.    <br>We know he who has memory is from the past. We understand that he who is aware is in the present. Then we must acknowledge that he who is enlightened is from the future.<br>Behold the Odyssey of Time. The years transform into a moment that defines an age. The weight of the future is the past and by the present it is belayed. When the present circumstance becomes unbearable the past will come crashing down destroying the future. -Master of Shadow Boxing<sep>Eh? What useful scientific information you&#39;ve just awarded me<sep>XDDDDD<sep>Is this his real channel<sep>😂😂😂<sep>How dare you assume it’s a planet?! What is a woman?! Pluto might identify as something else!<sep>😂<sep>Pluto is a planet.<sep>a dwarf planet tho<sep>So we was lost, none of us knew where we was, then all of a sudden Harry starts feeling around on the trees and he says I got it!

Set a “hard” example<br>2) revoke section 230 and allow all these parents of kids harmed psychologically by social media to sue their asses off. Bet they would fold then, and society will benefit <br>3) limit campaign contributions to $1000 per candidate per donor. Anything above that is election interference and should be jailable<br>4) pass a law setting tough consequences for fake news. It should be against the law to show bias. Better yet, ban commercials on news channels so that their is no indue influence from private and public companies. Eliminate “rich customer bias and influence”<br>5) make it illegal for Pharma to advertise, and make it illegal for them to exchange money between pharma and any other entity EXCEPT SUPPLIERS and business related transaction. NO ADVERTISING <br>6) eliminate the FSMB. No more undue influence on state med boards. We need this after they exceeded their authorities during the pandemic. They dictated what all states did through coordination with this entity.<br>7) ban dominion voting machines. The old ways of manual voting was more secure than digital voting. We need FAIR elections<sep>🔱Donald Trump🔱 is the president of hearts❤💙🧿🇮🇱🇺🇲<sep>Well said Mr. Trump. You don&#39;t have a country if there are no borders. What&#39;s happening under Biden is a joke.

sJlzDiNPacw,George Bush accidentally condemns himself on Iraq (then doubles down) #Shorts,"Did George W. Bush admit that the invasion Iraq was “unjustified and brutal”? During a speech, the former president had meant to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but instead slipped up, saying: “The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq. I mean of Ukraine. Iraq too.” Bush invaded Iraq in 2003, a decision that has been widely criticized. Pouya Alimagham, a modern Middle East historian at MIT, wrote on Twitter, “Wow —  the one time Bush told the truth about the invasion of #Iraq.”#Iraq #invasion #UkraineSubscribe for more videos: https://ajplus.co/subscribeSign up for subtext, our newsletter about the people and movements driving change in our society: https://ajplus.co/ekdv4Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ajplus/Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglishFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ajplus",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJlzDiNPacw,"How the U.S. Army bought a land for $1 and has been bombing, burning, and desecrating it ever since: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nsn4Sxy8r8"">https://youtu.be/-nsn4Sxy8r8</a><sep>At least he was the best President!<sep>Millions of my people were killed because of you I can’t describe how much I hate this devil<sep>Subconscious admission<sep>The scary part are the people who laugh so easy like &quot;oooh hey!

They feel spikey and alive.<sep>He&#39;s starting to look like Biden<sep>Everything comes to light.<sep>That guy is just a  criminal......<sep>Only it’s not funny - people laughing at that blunder - over a million Iraqis were murdered for a lie<sep>Allah is so funny, as He twists the liar&#39;s tongue to speak the truth!<sep>&quot;Anyway..&quot; <br>So easy to move on,like it was unimportant...<sep>that is karma, this men is killer, war criminal<sep>You’re a disgrace to America and what America used to stand for!!!<sep>The number one reason why the US became corrupted<sep>😂<sep>🤦 he really not have mind<sep>&quot;I mean Ukraine&quot;<sep>Vampire 🩸🧛🏼‍♂️<sep>The Truth is always Behind the Lie<sep>What a loser<sep>Evil 😈!!!<sep>The face of satan.<sep>Every year, 6,500 US veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars commit suicide because of this man. There are consequences for wicked actions. Unfortunately, in 20 years, 120,000 US veterans have died by their own hand, while Bush Jr. is alive and enjoying the millions of dollars he was paid by AIPAC.<sep>A colleague of mine worked directly for Bush. He used to tell me that bush would casually discuss war and US policy extremely nonchalant. The Freudian slip really was innocent because off the Record he acknowledges that his diplomacy was barbaric<sep>Spewing his HATE &amp; LIES..( NEEDS to LOOK IN THE MIRROR) These Elites are Lying MONSTERS..Perpetuating WARS Constantly-- NEVER Diplomacy, Friendliness Nor Mutual DIALOGUE..Only DEMONIZATION. ( * Bushie GETS PAID 500,000 Per Nauseating SPEECHES!!!)<sep>&quot;Yeah, Iraq was horrible. Lolz&quot;<sep>The people laughing are all going to Hell. Next to Bush himself.<sep>Jacques Chirac était contre cette invasion 🇫🇷 ☮️<sep>Discusting.<sep>Obama was singing off on drone strikes every tuesday killing hundreds of children 8 years of solid war for the nobel peace prize president, the whole Bush clan are the same armchair warhawk cowards.<sep>he has so much blood on hes hand<sep>It’s funny because so many people died for no justifiable reason. I can’t believe Bush even shows his face.<sep>He&#39;s a liar 💢<sep>Freudian slip<sep>It’s eerie af how people laugh at his mistake even though it’s the truth… the invasion of Iraq is far far worse than the Ukraine invasion. The USA sent in soldiers to kill the ‘enemy’, when in reality they were the enemy that started the Taliban and a lot of the chaos in the Middle East today. The USA has started wars, ended wars, and continues to do the same by manipulating the American people into believing they’re the good guys… like the Nazis did.<sep>Human conscience is the most brilliant thing in the <a href=""http://universe.you/"">universe.You</a> can&#39;t lie and trick to yourself<sep>God makes him spit out the truth, even you yourself can&#39;t deny wht you did anymore<br>Wallahua&#39;lam<sep>After his mistake he says &quot;Iraq too anyway&quot;. He already asumit his mistake but nothing happens. It&#39;s a shame<sep>The unappropriate laughter of the audience makes this horrible quote even worse<sep>And he chuckles about it<sep>Ladies and gentleman, The Devil Himself<sep>And the americans there just laughed like its the funniest thing they have ever heard.<sep>That man is just a man<sep>They can&#39;t keep getting away with this.<sep>Grandson of Alister Crawley. Son of Nazis,  Genasidal Psychopath. Does he not read? Is he not aware proficy would make him apart of satins army?<sep>Freudian slip anyone?<sep>Guilty conscience finally? Mmm<sep>The Mafia was already here, and It was completely out of control !<sep>That&#39;s how allah makes the liars speak out<sep>1 million innocent Iraqis plus another 3 million through sanctions. That’s 4 million innocent Iraqis killed by the US. That is somehow a knee slapper?? You wonder WHY everyone hates this country.<sep>He is a disgrace and a criminal<sep>Guilty of genocide and war crimes.<sep>And he still has nightmares<sep>Woooooow 😳 and there you go lady’s and gentlemen.<sep>He&#39;s talking about himself😅<sep>What a criminal <br>Truth will always reveal <br>Sometimes too late <br>So dnt condemn thinks you aint sure about<sep>Hahaha, more than 1.000.000 people, hahahaha &quot;anyway&quot; 😮<sep>Unjustified invasion of Iraq. You told on yourself.<sep>War criminal<sep>My boii got ptsd nightmares over Iraq<sep>👞🤡<sep>and people laughhhhh WAT THE FFFF is wrong with society<sep>what a despicable human being...<sep>B a s t a r d s !<sep>War criminal<sep>God might forgive you for what you’ve done as a leader but don’t expect the people to do the same , especially those who died because of your decisions .<sep>That laugh in the audience.!! Was that a joke!!!???????<sep>Their game at our expense…<sep>🐗😭😡<sep>You got right Bush invasion of iraq was your mistake<sep>Please God, dump this man in hell for all eternity<sep>I’ve known it for a long time. Trump has even told you, but you all were blinded by the media. If you still don’t see the truth, you’re dumb and there’s no hope for you. If this big piece of evidence doesn’t further confirm that your beliefs have always been wrong, don’t even pretend to be smart.<sep>Holy shit<sep>Why he joked about it? Millions of iraqi peoples life is a joke?<sep>Lmao his reaction and eventually saying &quot; eh,F it&quot; 😂<sep>PIG CRIMINAL !<sep>How all of them can laugh in the background? What’s so funny?<sep>lmfao<sep>The butcher of IRAQ<sep>Just one of the devil their many more😮<sep>He killed more iraki<sep>This is called Karma<sep>the older he gets, the more the guilty haunts him. he wont get a happy die<sep>Savages, destroyed most of the middle east, killed thousands and destroyed the infrastructure of these countries. He thinks its funny.<sep>War criminal, take him to International court<sep>Guilty as self charged. The butcher.<sep>Drinking again, you war criminal?<sep>He just three ticks above biden now, should have been charged with treason.<sep>Devil?<sep>US is about to do the same lies over and over again with Palestine and world would just stay silent.",0

Asked if he was positive about reaching a deal with US president Donald Trump over nuclear disarmament, Kim said it was too early to tell whether a deal could be reached.

He handled that so well. The media and flashes of cameras, and the cultural journal differentiations are disorientating. Donald handles journal abuse so well, he took control of the interviews he has, because sometimes the media can hurt, wensationalize, dehumanize , like peincess Dianna.

NK has tested their rockets more and more frequently. It was in summer 2017. I remember this fondly because at that time we were in Japan and the TV news channel reported on this and I was feeling uneasy since NK is not as far from Japan as my home country. As a reaction to this Trump posted an aggressive tweet. Then however, by his own statement, he talked to Kim and said he would like to visit him to talk about their situation. Which also marked a historic event. You can say what you want about Trump but he was the first US president to ever set foot into NK for diplomatic reasons. If people don&#39;t see the importance in that then they should probably try to educate themselves in the history of US and NK. The talks went positive and NK has softened their weapon testing. For a regime that is all about military and defense to lower their testing as a request by an outside president and a US president at that, is jaw dropping if you consider it diplomatically. The meeting could&#39;ve gone vastly different yet Trump managed to make the relation better. People who would only accept sth like democracy in NK as a noteworthy achievement by Trump are out of their mind. You have to work with what you get. I never saw past US presidents doing what Trump did with NK and I sure don&#39;t see anything of that regard happening with Biden, to be frank, it got worse once again with Biden. You can say what you will about Trump but in his four years the US saw a much healthier diplomatic relationship with China, NK and Russia, three big threats to the US government. All down the sink now that Biden is president. If you can&#39;t see the significance of that then be it but it means more than it sounds like. Or at least, it meant more. As said, relationships got worse again once Trump left. He&#39;s a businessman through and through. He knows how to talk to people and make deals.

You destroyed this country and are running it for Dementia Joe.<sep>Barack was a total loser!! MAGA BABY!!!<sep>Obama has and will always be an actor. That not who he is. DON&#39;T BE FOLD. FORGET ABOUT THE WORDS, LOOK AROUND.<sep>Good talk is not sign of a true president. We analyse the impact of every décision. Africa and the world was hell when he was in the office. If Biden remains president. The wars will only amplify. He is weak. Don&#39;t be fooled by talks. Obama knows Biden can&#39;t stand a chance.<sep>Obama was the start of the downfall of America and Biden picked up right where he left off.<sep>Trump was was a hundred times the president you ever was. You were as corrupt as the Clinton’s. The democrats are toast.<sep>All lies and more lies from obama<sep>Communism at its best speaking<sep>Lier<sep>President Trump is the best president ever and to say he didn&#39;t do anything makes me question, &quot; Is he talking about himself? What has Obama done  that&#39;s worth mentioning ?  I can&#39;t think of anything.  Obama was given a Nobel prize award but nobody knows what he has done  to deserve it. And even the one who  nominated him felt sorry he did because he said he didn&#39;t  realize that he will not do anything he said in his speech that inspired him to nominate him for the award. And even his own democrat colleagues were wondering how he won that award.<sep>Obama is a disgrace<sep>Free Assange free Palestine. There&#39;s no democracy at all. You se all under the Establishment of Zionist. America is done.<sep>Obama was an evil joke on the American people.<sep>What’s funny thing about it is that Obama’s shit show of a presidency is the reason everyone voted for Trump 🤣🤣<sep>You are a liar sir<sep>Yeah, Trump ain’t perfect but at least he doesn’t have dementia. He went from one of the most beloved to most hated just because he didn’t let the same puppet masters do what they wanted. And make no mistake, they running this shit. Biden can’t run it, so who do you think is? If anyone still believes the rhetoric about Trump, even after all this time and proof of his innocence in basically everything he was accused of, not even getting into the facts that it was actually Clinton who was the one talking with Russia, you really are past the point of no return. We can tell even without rehashing history that your presidency wasn’t good, because even you admit Joe is continuing your policies aka, open border leading to unprecedented crisis, inflation out the ass with high gas prices, food, bills etc. a shit show in the Middle East, the resurgence of conflict involvement in Israel and Ukraine…. Yeah. Same shit different Democratic president. I for one remember the struggle during your 8 years. I remember the shit show of my deployment too. Hey, I’ll give you that, at least you didn’t get soldiers killed directly by your stupidity, but plenty indirectly enough to draw the comparison. Prices were awful during your presidency too. Who cares about the middle class right? Under Trump I wasn’t just trying to get by. I wasn’t just surviving, I was actually doing well for myself. Literally not even a few months after Biden it was back to the struggle. Only reason everyone likes you is because you’re the first black president, and you got one of the best speech writers. There, I said it. You sold America the perfect dream, you sold me a bright future, and then flushed it down the toilet as soon as you stepped into office. I’ll take a monumental, self indulged troll who does what’s best for America over a dignified, well spoken candidate who chooses to run the country into the ground for the pure benefit of their party. And sleepy joe? Who can’t even find his way off a stage, off a bike or up a plane step….? Yeah, the fact you’re endorsing a man deemed innocent over hiding classified files in his garage only because he is mentally unfit to even understand what he is doing by official opinion…. That’s saying a lot. Love the man or hate him, we had no wars and life was affordable until democrats forced lockdowns, masks and jabs.<sep>Trump 2024! Down with Obama.<br> Down with Biden. What planet is Obama on?<sep>YouTube is woke<sep>Why will Obama not come out in support of securing the border from illegal entry? Why does Joe not secure it?<sep>I never voted for Obama, but he is a class act.  Can&#39;t say that about Trump.<sep>Un Enseignant pour faire Avancer La Tolérance  et Le Respect des deux Grands Partis Politiques et mettre en Échec Les Mesures qui Continuerons Les Clivages dans Le Pays et faire Réfléchir Régulièrement Sur Les Héritiers de L intolérance et Le Manque de Respect de Son Prochain ayant des Approches différents.<sep>Thanks bud for staying a fact !<sep>Thats it Trump never cared about Establishment.<sep>A clown asks trump to be serious.  Funny hallelujah<sep>You are a Liar<sep>Sounds like Bidon , Trump always caring for others , has always been a great guy , but he is not getting sucked in , to your Evil. Seems like Democrates are doing all the Thieving<sep>So we get a smooth talking SOB everyone is on this guy&#39;s nuts. Tell me one thing he did good for this county. And no killing Osama bin Laden doesn&#39;t count, I said for this country.....USA. The United States of America.<sep>Lol Obama wants his Puppet in charge so he will carry out his orders. I belive his Cheif was about to reveal this.<sep>Went into the White House with 1.3 million in wealth. Left the White House 4 years later with 70 million in wealth. Oh yes truly great president😂. The one that would draw red lines in the sand, been retreat backwards and draw another one. Weak President, except regaining his own wealth<sep>Thank You President Barack Obama. Shit! We miss you as President some kinda bad 😭.<sep>In a crazy world? You need a crazy leader! That is why two bullies never engage each other.<sep>Obamas mouth is a cesspool.<sep>Is he talking about biden<sep>Your a bad guy<sep>Word<sep>Obama is the biggest lying corrupt person ever with his transgender wife<sep>The dude is a fool.<sep>OMG I can not listen to this complete fraud talk about &quot;takin the job seriously.&quot;<sep>Wow..really...<sep>Trump did not embrace your policy, but your political appointees lingering in government gravy train did and they launched impeachment after impeachment.  Under Obama, China became stronger and took away all the manufacturing jobs.  When pandemic hit, we found we were at the mercy of Chinese.  Our hospital staff and medical teams had no gloves, gowns, masks to protect themselves and even worse for the general public.  All medical supplies and vital medicines were manufactured in China, in addition to our household items.  Obama’s brother-in-law was even became a consultant to many Chinese firms.  We shut down practically all business because no masks to stop the virus spread.  As the result, how  many people die?  And how many businesses even today can’t be recovered.  Trump ordered vaccines to be made;  rethink the supply chain.  Under Obama, all things were made in China and all our top universities student slots were given to Chinese students with scholarships.  Our kids were huddled around community colleges and universities Chinese students could not learn our science and technology.  We now wonder how can Chinese brilliantly come up with TikTok, drones with military capabilities to kill the Ukrainians.  Yes Sir, you did take your job seriously, you have emboldened Chinese to think they are the supply center and the economic center of the world.  They launch plans to build  roads  and ports leading to China for generations to use.<sep>Trump is only for his self we really need to vote him out vote blue trump is a big idiot 🎉😂😂😂❤<sep>We miss you!<sep>Trump’s a psychopath Obama, he cares for nothing and nobody else, if he could he’d marry himself.<sep>Trump is for the people of America MAGA!<sep>obama is a neo marxist, he can shut up now.<sep>He inherited a good economy from you, Mr. Obama, after your eight years of work, and in his four years, it went to shit now we’re in a recession and his little minions think Biden ruined it, and it was so much better under him.. I wish more people would read and research and stop listening to these news outlets because a lot of times they’re only getting a little piece of what’s tea going on.<sep>Two terms may not be enough. Notice a man that can clearly speak with logic and she just makes sense. Unlike the DJT. VOTE🔵💙🔵💙🔵<sep>He said it Doneld Trump helped his friend&#39;s.The People of the United States are his friends 😮<sep>Trump 2024 US President.... Obama your time is expired your services is no longer  required.... so zip it !!!🖕🏽🖕🏽<sep>I don&#39;t agree with Obama at all - not one bit - but of course, Obama isn&#39;t going to agree with Trump on anything at all - zilch - he disagreed with Trump on most everything - we see the debt were in because of Obama and Biden - the debt they created doesn&#39;t bother them one bit<sep>TRUMP 2024 ❤<sep>Barrack Hussein  Obama is a American hating Muslim<sep>Wot about the Anti wedding drones then?<sep>Obama Gaddafi is in the graveyard 🪦 please let us in peace.<sep>Lock and load <br>Fuck you Barry<br>Trump 2024<sep>You talk a lot of crap 💩  Obama<sep>Fuck you, Obama, you ruined this country and you divided it to the point where it may never come back together.<sep>I’m from Salford uk, I always thought Obama was sincere and wanted the best for average American citizens, I see trump as a petulant, bullying, unintelligent, uncaring, arrogant narcissist<sep>This brother is all talk<sep>Mr Trump is not going to change that the way he is and He is all for himself I pray more taxes than he did and we don&#39;t need a president in America like Him your vote do matter and only the people can do that like they done for you $ peace ✌️<sep>IS YOUR PRESIDENCY SELECTED BY THE COMPUTERS OR BY AMERICANS PEOPLES??? INCLUDING BIDEN<sep>He did a better job than you though.<sep>You all must be high if you think this guy and sleep joe did a better job than Trump lol<sep>Nothing but deception coming out of that dude&#39;s mouth. Remember this is the guy that repealed the law against anti-propaganda<br><br>The reason we have all the dissolutionment in America is because he has allowed propaganda to proliferate the media<sep>he used executive time lock in the room watching news<sep>A great public speaker who did f all as President.<sep>Trump only cares about himself..he didn&#39;t care about this country..hes a joke and needs to be locked up.<sep>Ai ...Beeyyy, audios berry<sep>Thank you former President Obama it&#39;s nice to hear you explain what he should have done not to mention his excess baggage 🎉🎉🎉<sep>Put the Orange Lunatic in prison.<sep>TRUMP &quot;2024&quot;<sep>President Obama thank you for making it clear the stakes in the 2024 election. 🇺🇸❤️<sep>Trump is a narcissistic he will never love anyone or anything other than himself. He never care for USA or the American people, less for the White House or the positioning of President for the better cause of the Nation, he never care for that, only thing he cares is himself and the feeling of power and  being treated like a king or a dictator. Which that is what he wants.<sep>Amen President Obama<sep>You all better wake up. Obama wants to overturn our constitution and turning our country into a dictatorship.  He is using Biden as Puppet.  He is responsible for the state of out country and world.<sep>Imagine... the 2nd worse president criticizing  the best.<sep>Lol these comments are hilarious<sep>DONALD Trump was the best potus ever you obama is who divided this country not Trump<sep>Oh and Obama is Responsible for Hating the County and Our Constitution - Please Explain Dems fools and Biden gave Ukraine WAY too much money that fool got it to pay CEOs and our Military is Awesome without him<sep>He is the one ruined medical system!<sep>Trash. Trump 2024<sep>Donald Trump did take his job seriously he didn’t stick around with his thumb up his ass in the oval office like you did<sep>Mr.Obama I was doing good and went back and forth to school with $40. On the year before biden. And that is under Donald. La verdad yo soy Americano and I Bileieve your did great for the people. But we, the people and including myself, are hitting homelessness. Why?<sep>Just so you OBAMA, you don&#39;t even have control of the presidency. No one ever does,you guys are just faces that are controlled by bigger powers. You guys are just pons that the king and queen use. So why not put interest, you can&#39;t control it<sep>You are a scam you and your friend Joe Biden please go away just like Dr. Fauci<sep>they ran the wh like a high school activities club<sep>You cannot see Obama&#39;s lying here, This is stupid.  I never disliked Obama, but NO ONE worked harder than Trump.  Especially killing terrorist? No one was better than Donald Trump. Trump made sure his military was STRONG. Trump eradicated ISIS. Trump  humiliated Valdimir Putin when  300 Wagner mercinaries dissapeard from terrorizing Syria destablizing the middle east. Putin didn&#39;t believe Trump either. You think the news reported what Trump actually did?  CNN MSNBC NBC CBS ABC etc NEVER reported FACTS. Putin didn&#39;t even hold press conference. Putin knew Trump meant what he said when Trump sent warnings.  Both Hamas and Putin wouldve listened to Trump, or be dead LONG BEFORE the attacks, invading Ukraine and Israel.  Biden doesn&#39;t care about people. Biden doesn&#39;t work as president. Two months ago Biden had 411 missing, vacation days since he became president.<sep>🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮<sep>Biden has continued Obama&#39;s policy and is destroying our country<sep>People are so ignorant Obama is the anti Christ<sep>The Marxist son of a Communists drunk his mentor was Frank Marshall Davis CPM<sep>Good  man<sep>I didn&#39;t know big mike ran for president<sep>So true President Obama<sep>I am not an American and I&#39;m hoping Americans don&#39;t vote for trump.. he is a threat to the world.. he is insane..<sep>🇺🇲🫡🇺🇲<sep>You&#39;re right Mr. President. DT seriously doesn&#39;t care about the welfare of the American people but only cares for himself and his friends and his cult. He does not care if he violates the laws or the Constitution because he feels or thinks he is always above the law. He is a very dangerous man to the Americans, the USA and its democratic allies dependent to it  for support and the preservation and protection of democracy, world or international peace and order.<sep>You are not even a citizen! The worst president ever besides Biden !",0

LwsKBrCvZ_w,Ukrainian PM says Putin is ‘absolutely’ responsible for purported beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers,"Ukrainian Prime Minister, Denys Shmyhal responds to the two videos released on Pro-Russian social media  that purport to show Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers and says he considers these acts war crimes. #CNN #News",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwsKBrCvZ_w,"The United States is used to posing as the masters of the world. They call those who carry out their orders democratic and free. They try to force those who pursue an independent policy with sanctions. Now they have forced Ukraine to unleash a war on the border with Russia in 2014. As a result, Ukraine is dying. The United States forced Europe to impose sanctions against Russia. As a result, Europe has lost cheap Russian resources and is destroying its economy. It is already clear to everyone that the United States is doing this not out of love for democracy, but out of greed for other people&#39;s resources.<sep>There&#39;s a reason they took the dislike button away.<sep>🤣🤣🤣 These ARE THE SAME KINDS OF &quot;WMD LIES&quot; we heard for the justification for war in Iraq.

The word &quot;gall&quot; doesn&#39;t adequately describe it.

The USA is arming Taiwan to give their Government the allusion they can win a war against China. Think about it. In 2014 NATO, Obama&amp;Biden started the Ukrainian war by training 900 thousands Ukrainians and put lot of weapons including biologic weapons labs in Ukraine to give their Government the allusion they could win a war against Russia, most if not all of that 900K are now dead.

Our primary focus is to provide sustained assistance to Ukraine to prevent any future problems.<sep>Saw this video earlier. This is what the world needs to see, if they still don&#39;t understand who Ukraine is fighting against.

Disgraceful.<sep>We must stop this PutlerRegim!<sep>Donot You think it may be fake<sep>Bakhmut battle does not make sense to me. Ukraine is exposing its soldiers to street fighting which is increasing their mortality. What is weird is that russia and Ukraine are engaged in this and nowhere else in Ukraine is exposed to this type of fighting. It&#39;s just odd.<br>I am definitely for Ukraine, however there are things that are hard to understand.<sep>This is exactly what the USA did in Libya, Iraq, Syria, Vietnam, Korea, Panama, and everywhere that is non mzungu areas.<sep>All Ukraine 🇺🇦 nationalities must co-exist.<sep>Mr Putin is the best president ever!!! Go Russia 🇷🇺<sep>After the published execution of a Ukrainian soldier by fascist Russian occupiers, let some political prostitute say that it is worth sitting down to the negotiating table with Russia and agreeing ... Now on the battlefield, when the Russian occupiers will be taken alive, before the eyes of Ukrainian soldiers there will be a picture of the hero and ... woe to Russian slugs. Why were German invaders afraid of Soviet soldiers during World War II? Because they understood that with their own neck they would have to answer for crimes in the occupied territories. And the fury of the answer will be inevitable and merciless.<sep>После опубликованной казни украинского солдата фашистскими российскими оккупантами пусть какая-то политическая проститутка скажет, что с Россией стоит садиться за стол переговоров и договариваться... Теперь на поле боя, когда российских оккупантов будут брать живьём, перед глазами украинских воинов будет стоять картина обезглавливания украинского героя и... горе российским ушлёпкам. Почему во время 2-й мировой войны немецкие захватчики боялись советских солдат? Потому что понимали, что собственной шеей им придётся отвечать за преступления на оккупированных территориях. И ярость ответки будет неотвратимой и беспощадной.<sep>Why he does not tell about atrocities  to russians  who live in ucraine by ucraine solders?<sep>Woe.

He has no future other than being China&#39;s puppet and a war criminal.

Waste of my time watching this clip<sep>In response to all declarations by international organizations, Russia denies any culpability but cannot provide evidence.

The FBI verified the laptop was legit today, Ratcliffe verified it two days ago and your sons business partner came out and said it was all true today and that he’ll testify because he doesn’t want to go to prison.

If you think it&#39;s mandatory for customers to tip, just add the price to the menu directly, and I&#39;ll gladly pay it. <br>Just as Rachael&#39;s dad said, &quot;I pay 200 dollars for the dinner, and you come up as mr big shot?&quot;<br>It&#39;s not about being cheap. It&#39;s about the absurdity of this culture that normalizes this insanity.<sep>i love seeing her feet. especioally her soft soles.<sep>WHO WAS IT??????!!!!<sep>He pays the 100 dollar bill and she gives a 10 dollar tip and thinks she is a saint<sep>maybe he was just broke..<sep>Talk about 1st world country problems<sep>Elle est génial cette femme le rêve<sep>so Happy 3rd divorce<sep>Kaley is Ross Geller<sep>According to her , I am cheap . Yeah that is it.<sep>Passe  le bonjour à RAHDJ....LINDIEN. ....MERCI<sep>10+ mit *<sep>I would hit it raw but this girl is spoiled af<sep>tipping system in America sucks <br><br>In my country there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;tipping&quot; there&#39;s only bribery<sep>I want to know how many guys Kaley has slept with , seems like a lot.<sep>Then she married a drug addict.<sep>This chicks is just bitter cause that  emma stone gal was just a tad bit more talented<sep>Wow 👏 😮 👏<sep>dudes don’t be cheap.<sep>It was $uperman, wasn&#39;t it....<sep>If she’s talking about I think she is (Henry Cavill) then three things:<br>1. Henry is British and our waiters have a decent salary without having to rely on tips so if it’s him then all she had to do was tell him cause I wouldn’t have a freaking clue how much to tip in the US cause most countries don’t have to worry about that, tips are just a bonus to waiters. Feel bad for US waiters but she didn’t need to call him out just tell him.<br>2. Why couldn’t she tip if she felt so strongly??? Did he have to pay for everything? open your purse<br>3. If it is Henry, she’s no angel either. Henry has said she threw a glass at his head! Glad he left.<sep>well, studies show that 99% of people who tip, are white guys. So, most likely this dude wasn&#39;t a white guy....just saying...<sep>She could have politely informed him and helped him figure out how to tip properly. Not just judge him and complain that he&#39;s cheap. Besides he did pay 600 bucks for dinner, so he can&#39;t be that cheap.<sep>Love this video<sep>I really hope this is supposed to be ironic...<sep>American tipping culture is just bad<sep>CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHO THAT WAS ??<sep>I wanna know who he is because if he’s British that is a completely different story because we don’t tip (everyone gets minimum wage and there usually a service charge included)<sep>Lmfao at the beginning I judged her. Towards the end I fell in love. I feel you. $600 and $13 tip. Yeah. No<sep>Does kaley have children?<sep>This was so stupid<sep><b>gets taken out to a restaurant</b><br><br>HES CHEAP<br><br>What do I expect for watching sad hot girls<sep>He’s talking about johnny (Leonard in BBT)<sep>Tipping system has a lot to do with exploitation of labour....I never tip<sep>I love kaley but.... This is really stupid... Shows how fragile marriage and relationships are in the West<sep>American tipping system, oof. Just pay proper wages and it&#39;ll not be a big of a deal<sep>Kaley Cuoco is so cute. i love that cute smile of hers<sep>I bet he&#39;s Johnny Galecki<sep>Its johnny galecki<sep>I just love her 😍😍😍😍<sep>Just reminded of Rachel&#39;s dad too!!! : D<sep>🙂 such a big problem.<sep><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23firstworldproblems"">#firstworldproblems</a><sep>I think the common man can really relate to this story<sep>She could have just told him to tip more and non of that would be a big problem<sep>8% of $600 is $48 in contrast the $13 of 2,2% of the amount. Initially,  a 10% tip is fair and square.<sep>I used to have a crush on Kaley but... She didn&#39;t age well. Looks older than what she is 😕<sep>If you mute the video and put a pornhub logo on it you will spare yourself.<sep>Why not pay the server instead of... oops sorry I forgot Americans, the workers should obviously be paid by the whims of rich people wanting to feel generous.<sep>Am I the only one who started watching the video, cause I thought he was a bad &quot;tripper&quot; expecting some great story of how they tripped on shrooms?<sep>There is nothing wrong with being financially prudent.<sep>Im I the only one thinking she&#39;s the crazy one??!!!<br>She broke up what sounded like a great relashionship beacuse she coulnt handle the fact he was tipping 8-10% its not like he&#39;s not tipping at all...<sep>Johnan Hill 🤔<sep>It was Kevin Zegers<sep>this is ross and rachels father situation..<sep>IF YOU CAN&#39;T AFFORD A 20% TIP YOU CAN&#39;T AFFORD TO EAT OUT. THE END.<sep>Everyone I  know who complains about tipping happens to be cheap themselves. Tip your servers well and you will get even better service next time. It&#39;s worked like a charm for me.<sep>She&#39;s Shallow and He was Cheap...bad combo<sep>hes cheap for paying for her meals? she looks like the big shot for giving 10% of the bill as a tip lol<sep>I wonder how many (more) of these can be incredible women describing a fundamental element of my character as an instant &quot;nope&quot; to a relationship<sep>it wasn&#39;t johnny<sep>Love her ❤❤<sep>Who was it? Lol<sep>Good video.<sep>I know.. 🤭🤭🤭<sep><b>&quot;if I told you his name, you&#39;d know who he is.&quot;</b><br>well that&#39;s usually how it works<sep>When she was 19 phones were huge?<br>In what universe? According to wikipedia she was born in 1985, so was 19 in 2004. The same year the hottest phone (which I had at the time) was the Motorola Razr. Tiny compared to today&#39;s phones. The 3 phones I had prior to that were even smaller.<sep>David spade 😂<sep>I’ve heard this story before! Where though, was it in a magazine or something?!<sep>I&#39;d rather be a crappy tipper than a shallow vapid bimbo who a. dumped a promising relationship because her daddy potentially disapproved of one aspect of her boyfriend&#39;s personality and b. is still whining about it and airing her dirty laundry for publicity fifteen years later. Cheap tipper vs cheap person.<sep>My girlfriend does not have that problem... I always take her out for dinner to the drive-thru. Problem solved.<sep>I love you for making this video<sep>First World Problems.<sep>TIPPIN IS OPTIONAL<sep>Why do I think it&#39;s John Mayer?<sep>American tipping system sucks. Pay properly salaries to staff or include a service charge in the bill.<sep>garbage<sep>ok this is the dumbest story I&#39;ve ever heard. Also I didn&#39;t think Tom Cruise is such a bad tipper<sep>He covers the $600 dinner bill for her family but he&#39;s cheap because he doesn&#39;t drop another $120 in tip?? And then you break up with him?<br>Wow, he&#39;s a &quot;bad tipper&quot; is the worst thing you could come up with for this guy and that was the deal breaker ......<sep>the guy was Bret Bollinger<sep>¿dónde está la gracia de ésta chica?....<sep>This reminds me of friends episode with Rachael&#39;s father where he says i pay 200$ for dinner, you pay 20 for the tip and you become the good guy. If you couldn&#39;t just confront him with such small issue, this relationship was going to end sooner or later.<sep>В жизни она тоже алкошит<sep>Hey Kaley Cuoco?  Name Johnny Depp?<sep>WOW<sep>I used to date someone exactly like this last summer. After 4 dates I got rid of him. He was very,very cheap. He didn´t pay anything when we did go out for dates and he never gave anybody tips. Once we were going to the movie theater and I paid for both of us...<sep>Is he Johnny??? Leonard!!!!!<sep>Maybe Johnny Galecki???<sep>I&#39;ve watch these Vogue videos and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion they have a foot fetish 😁😀😁<sep>If the guy doesn&#39;t top or behaves like this, he IS cheap &amp; ladies, drop him.  It&#39;s a bad sign- a red flag-a warning- an omen about the guy. Life&#39;s too short to deal with such a selfish, petty loser.<sep>YEAH, in America, your sever could throw the food in your face and you’d still be considered trash for not tipping 💵 😂 🤭<sep>You are over 30 and you talk like a 20 year old. I just unliked you. Didn&#39;t think it was possible.<sep>So she dumped her &quot;dream man&quot; because of ONE THING that could have changed. And now we have other girls thinking, &quot;I should be more like her.&quot; Yeah...no...<sep>His name was Ben Affleck.<br>I mean just read her lips.<sep>It&#39;s Kevin Zegers or Thad Luckinbill<sep>Kevin Zegers, it’s the only match with her being 19 since she’s 33 now and they dated in 2003-2004.<sep>It’s Kevin Zegers<sep>If you’re paying for a $600 bill... YOU ARE NOT CHEAP!! I still love her<sep>She is also cute in real life<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂",0

Mexican cartels with the protection of the current President are assassinating politicians from the opposition and forcing Mexican people out of their land to join them or kill them. Mexico is part of North America, your neighbor and economic partner. Most of the China manufacturing could be done in Mexico. Mexicans need your HELP!! You don’t want to arm terrorists that are your neighbors. Look at Gaza ! The fight is here in North America.<sep>Trump 2024!!<sep>Most countries have borders with men with guns guarding them. If someone tries to cross their border they die. The US does not have a border at this moment in time. Biden is not for America.

The world needs to decriminalise all drugs. These war on drugs only keeps cartels in business and governments taking away your rights and freedoms. Make drugs legal, tax them, supply them, quality control them and educate. Recent studies prove that over dose deaths have not increased in countries where drugs have been legalised or decriminalised.<sep>God bless Trump!

It doesn&#39;t take a body language expert to see when he is worried.<sep>Let&#39;s talk IMPORTANT:  the documented information of how Biden family sold this country out for financial gain.  It&#39;s significant.

So if there is institutional racism it’s the left’s fault not Trump’s!<sep>Trump is a clown<sep>Everytime he says institutional or systemic racism, he&#39;s admitting he&#39;s been a failure for over 47yrs. This argument goes against any type of reasonable thinking.<sep>1994<sep>He is a part of the institutional racism.<sep>I&#39;m Joe Biden, and I hate police officers.<sep>Bro like how are these people in the comments not accepting that biden is spitting straight FACTS<sep>The more comments that are posted, regardless of what they contain, helps to get the video recommended to YouTubers.

I feel strongly that most of them are an abomination to our freedom and safety.  If Trump is representing republican policies, then yes my vote is for him.

LOL.  You get up on stage in front of millions of viewers and answer these hot topics better....BTW it&#39;s all laid out on Biden&#39;s website.  Go there, click on Joe&#39;s Vision and for the topic of institutional racism I suggest starting with Domestic Policy.  It contains real plans, goals, and policies.<sep>Russia make Donald duck great again<sep>Bruh we aren’t systematically racist anymore<sep>Without this imaginary racism, the Democrats would be out of business.<sep>VETERANS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP 2020!!!<sep>Trump 2020<sep>Tony Bobulinski spread the word<sep>Vote for Biden and make CCP great again.<sep>When will Joe denounce Richard Spencer’s endorsement?  When will the Orwellian media ask him for the denouncement?<sep>There is!  It’s called affirmative action and it needs to go the way of Jim Crow.<sep><b>I can&#39;t believe Biden ain&#39;t in jail!!! C&#39;mon man!!!</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>Sleepy joe has no plan</b><sep>I am so sick of people playing racial cards<sep>BIDEN 2020<sep>poor kids are as smart as white kids- joe Biden<sep>Joe got schooled<sep>Fr. Altman: You cannot be Catholic &amp; a Democrat. Period. (Part I)<br><br>Search it<sep>Better ? Please explain your plans Joe 😂. Explain what your gonna do to this country.<sep>Everything makes sense now. Even before Trump was elected in 2016, he was under attack from top democrats and the media. They want him out because they know they are corrupted and Trump been the outsider will expose them. Top democrats were shocked when Trump won the 2016 election. Straight away democrats created fake source to impeach Trump to get him out. Democrats are scared of this corruption by Biden family. The deeper you dig, you will likely to find many top democrats all involved.<sep>Remember to vote Biden 2020<sep>President Trump is the Action Man, the one walking and chewing gum at the same time. Biden and Obama the Hope &amp; Change candidates peddled fear and sold out to the War Lobby and Special Interests for 8 years. Now  they are back at the trough asking for more.  VOTE TRUMP VOTE FOR PEACE NOT WAR. VOTE FOR JOBS. VOTE FOR YOUR POCKETS.  All Americans know better than to trust the Politicians. They tabled the same issues every election year for 47 years.<sep>Yes, systematic racism in your systematic prison of African Americans. You had 8 years to help African Americans, but you were too busy flying around the world collecting bribery money. Actually, I&#39;m wrong. It is the bag man Hunter collects for you while you were sleeping in the office<sep>Institutional racism = when you ran out of racism.<sep>&quot;Poor kids are just as bright as white kids&quot;<sep>You got my vote, big dog.<sep>Bring up racism, a Democrats ol&#39; reliable.<sep>Awesomeness<sep>How long has Joe Biden been in politics exactly, can you really trust a man that&#39;s been in the system that long to fight against &quot;institutional racism&quot;?<sep>BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT 2020!<sep>Biden is the man.<sep>Trump hugely supported and helped black communities and NAACP way before running for president and they supported him right back. He was loved by black communities but let’s not talk about that.<sep>Of course Joe would be an expert on systematic racism, considering he&#39;s the author of the &#39;94 crime bill<sep>The biggest threat for the US it&#39;s not the covid-19,immigration or racism but China. The only man to stand before China is Trump. Who built the cages Joe???<sep>Go Joe go! Only candidate that actually answered the questions with a concise plan!<sep>I was watching this live, (i was on my phone) and every time I looked up Joe looked like he was about to cry and I legit felt bad for him<sep>WHO BUILT THE CAGES, JOE?<sep>Joe Biden knows in his heart that he is the only one who can truly defeat Abraham Lincoln this November.<sep>Biden only promise. He will not keep it.  We are tired of politician<sep>America no need enemy, because America has Trump.<sep>Email scandal of  joe bide...he will sell usa to china for next 4 years<sep>BIDEN/HARRIS 2020<sep>GO GO GO JOE BIDENNNNN PRESIDENT YEAAAAA 💪🇺🇲<sep>GOP/kremlin trolls pretending it&#39;s 1990 make me laugh, it only proves they got nuthin&#39;.<sep>BIDEN PRESIDENT 2020<sep>Republicans for Joe Biden<sep>220,000 deaths under this president. I am voting for Biden period!<sep>If systemic racism is such an obstacle for minorities, why didn’t you fix it in your 47 years in politics, Joe??<br>Instead; 94’ crime bill.

Why are they talking about that BS. Israel is gonna get us all killed<sep>👌👌👌👌👌🫂🫂🫂🫂😭😭😭😭<sep>The killings is as a result of October 7th...<sep>In the name of Allāh<br><br>Say, &quot;O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.&quot; But if they turn away, then say, &quot;Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].&quot;<br><br><br>Al-Quran - Surah ٣ - Aal-i-Imraan - Ayah ٦٤<br><br><br>O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason?<br><br><br>Al-Quran - Surah ٣ - Aal-i-Imraan - Ayah ٦٥<br><br><br>Here you are - those who have argued about that of which you have [some] knowledge, but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows, while you know not.<br><br><br>Al-Quran - Surah ٣ - Aal-i-Imraan - Ayah ٦٦<br><br><br>Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists.<br><br><br>Al-Quran - Surah ٣ - Aal-i-Imraan - Ayah ٦٧<br><br><br>Say, &quot;We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him.<br><br><br>Al-Quran - Surah ٣ - Aal-i-Imraan - Ayah ٨٤<br><br>،،<br><br><br>And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, &quot;We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you.

They said, We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God. And we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.<br>،،<br>Say, [O believers], We have believed in Allāh and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants [al-Asbāṭ] and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.<sep>Cant believe he is making a comedy show on the blood of innocent people.<sep>You’re amazing, you actually encapsulate everything perfectly<sep>This guy makes me smile ear to ear!<sep>💯 true and very unique eyes mashAllah<sep>Uncomfortable talking points 😂<sep>This Hamas mouthpiece is disgusting<sep>Totally correct! All support!<sep>Indians had no idea Bassem was involuntarily embarrassing his host India by his sense of humour that brutally mocks Israel, USA and the west that includes India as an ally.<sep>❤🙏<sep>This is the side youtube does&#39;t show to the viewers...<sep>Thank you ❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Please youtube influencers speak for the people in a Genocide.<sep>Thank you for your beautiful loud brave voice<sep>Why didn’t he address all those points rather than spewing them out?😂<sep>Great man with a great mind . Free Palestine 🇵🇸<sep>Mentiions all the questions doesn&#39;t answer 1<sep>They talk bullisht<sep>BS has been ongoing since 1948.<br>No one is listening to their BS anymore.

Palestinians love to say this against Israel never looking at their side never looking at their POV. He is clearly a Palestinian Supporter and doesn&#39;t care at all about what happend so bad that day on October 7th. He wants to just push his views about Israel Plaestine but this isn&#39;t about that it is Hamas doing a really bad thing in Israel and then twisting every situation and Israel&#39;s retaliation. Russia is not getting this much backlash for killing civillians in Ukraine because people are influenced by Hamas Propoganda like this guy here and most of the Western World. Yes there is murder happening in the world all the time but in Palestine it is not everyday and it certainly isn&#39;t something the country of Israel wants. The IDF&#39;s Plan isn&#39;t to go and kill innocent Palestinians in the west bank but to occupy Isreali Land that Israel has gained over history.  I Stand With Israel When No One Will 🇮🇱🇮🇱<sep>All I can say is the way he jokes about some of the atrocities on the other side causes him to loose credibility<sep>Honestly, we all need to realize that their talking points are DISTRACTION. We need DIRECT ACTION NOW TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.<sep>I am outraged at the 6million juice murdered on October the 7th.  Juice never lie, don&#39;t believe conspiracy theories.  Aipac is good.<sep>I think Piers must be regretting bringing Bassem to his show. He is huge now<sep>💯💯💯💯💯 well said and directly said lovely. Free Palestine enough is enough 🙌🇵🇸. Allahu Akbar.<sep>Thanks to you, shame on dishonesty of western media western democracy. 😢<sep>😂😂❤<sep>Big respect to Baseem freedom to PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸.<sep>Kids, dont do meth.<sep>Free Palestine<sep>Well said Mr Bassem!<sep>Pure Genius, is this guy 👏👏👏<sep>October 7 October 7 all B.S<sep>exactly, they are trying to distract us from the atrocities they are committing.<sep>Well said❤<sep>True, they are thinking people don’t know anything, shame on Israel and their hypocrites media<sep>THIS💯<sep>Joker<sep>They&#39;ve tried everything in the Satanic book to justify the occupation, starvation and killing of thousands of innocent Palastinenian men, women and mostly children .<sep>He is liable to make fools of them they will be embarrassed in public every time its brought up because his oration and face expression will have forced their funny bone ,they will involuntarily laugh uncontrollably ,thus look outrageously INSANE AND EVIL😂!!! GOOD ONE! VERY FREAKING CLEVER ,ORIGINAL!😂!<sep>fair play i totally agree<sep>I LOVE HIS BIG EYES!❤😂 HE HAS THE GREATEST VOICE!<sep>DONT WE HAVE AN ARAB AMERICAN LEAGUE IN USA?❤ ARE THEY FREE??🇺🇸📢🆘️❤️‍🩹🔊🌐🔊👉🛢⛽️💣🔥💀💨⚠️⏳️🗞<sep>I AM OUTRAGED AND CONDEMNED!❤<sep>Palestine 🇵🇸 will be free ❤❤❤<sep>Very nice<sep>I love u❤<br>Free Palästina 🇵🇸",0

My dad works for the Indian Government. I have lived inside a Government colony all my life. I know how Indian government officials talk. I cooperates with the USA. But, the Indian politicians and the Indian people openly talk about how USA is responsible for creating wars around the world. Indians are generally anti-USA, anti-white, anti-British. The BJP government was responsible for a genocide of Muslims in India. There is a lot of negative publicity in India about the USA. I live in Mumbai. India is also pro-Russia. The BJP spends millions of dollars to fund the media and control the media. Senator, please be concerned with India. India cooperates with the USA, but government is shaping Indian  opinions to be anti-USA, anti-British, anti-white. The Indian government uses anti-white propaganda.

NjJjm78TyGw,Why won't Trudeau call China's Xi Jinping a dictator? #Canada #China #Trudeau #XiJinping,"Responding to a reporter’s question about why he won't call China's President Xi Jinping a ""dictator"" despite U.S. President Joe Biden doing so during a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: “Listen, we can get into all sorts of different definitions. The fact is, he's not running a democracy. It's an authoritarian state.” #APEC #APEC 2023 #Canada #China #Trudeau #Xi #BidenFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/10098548/trudeau-apec-summit-presser/",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjJjm78TyGw,"Oh, you can tell it’s a pre-thought answer. Nodding your head yes is a good indication that you’re not fully listening.. especially when the question isn’t finished being asked. <br><br>The biggest issue with this country is that we send a check when we need to pay bills. Just because you print my money doesn’t mean you have more.<sep>He can&#39;t call one of his bosses a dictator.<sep>It was US and European Democracy that destroyed the world not China.<sep>press going out of their ways to ask questions that has the potential to destroy our relationship with China... 100% the journalist had no other intention than to muddy up our exchanges with China. Hope we get a chance to ask that exact question to the president of US<sep>They had gentlemen&#39;s agreement, most likely.<sep>The reporter should ask this demon. The same question about Canada<sep>Two parties like the US is still inefficient government, and it doesn&#39;t do a damm thing for citizens. It only looks after its own inner circles.<sep>So Democracy means dictatorship?<sep>Need guts to tell in public the truth<sep>Is it Canada or China     T RuThdoe  is thinking of<sep>Running an authoritarian state. Look in the mirror fidel<sep>Stupid question by the reporter who is simply fishing for a headline. There is no point to this question, and no benefit in calling the leader of a super power “a dictator”. Even though he is.<sep>He know winnie the pooh is a sensitive girl<sep>I don&#39;t know if you can criticize Trudeau for not wanting to create a diplomatic incident by insulting another head of state for no reason.<sep>How can he call his boss a dictator?<sep>Lol xi is his father<sep>He works for china<sep>Justin Trudeau himself is dictator 😂<sep>You label whatever stupid name on others you want.  At the end, it is what they do and result of what they do that count. You can call yourself democracy or freedom but that bring to people nothing but more chaos, unstable and economic hardship.  That brings more wars, massacre, real genocide, misery, suffering and destructions in other countries including China.  For all these reasons, I would rather stay away for American and Canadian systems.<sep>Because he’s a Dictator himself<sep>Trudeau the dictator. You are hardly democratic going after trucker&#39;s bank accounts.<sep>This man should be in books about psychology,  so many good videos with him<sep>Weak another one like our Joey<sep>He refuses to answer a direct question with a direct answer because it can be misinterpreted as hate speech then be used against him to send him to prison thus causing him to give himself a pardon to stay free undermining his own parties bills and legislation ... how many clowns does it take in government to run a country into the ground not very many, and that&#39;s worldwide across board in western civilisation<sep>He looks more and more like fidel every day...<sep>sociopath<sep>Would you describe your mother as a fertile woman?<sep>He shivers to even utter ! Weak leader!<sep>Silly Little Tyrant<sep>PUPPET 😂<sep>What is really a dictator?<sep>this guy looks and sounds lioke hes on coke<sep>You don&#39;t need to have more than one party to be a democracy.   Democracy simply means the people vote on the leadership.  Has nothing to do how many parties exists.  In China you can change the policy, but not the party.  In the West you change the parties, but not the policy.   There is a reason Chinese government are more efficient than Western governments.<sep>Is Canada a democracy ?! Is the US one ?! We all live in dictatorship so better all focus on our own<sep>Cause he has common sense not to answer it as it definitely would effect money<sep>Canada, just a little boy for serving America<sep>You can’t really call another head of state a dictator it ruins relations and that’s not how diplomacy works. There must be mutual respect. I despise Trudeau but I kinda understand him herw<sep>He&#39;s a joke<sep>Same guy who took peoples rights for firearms, in running a dictatorship in Canada, i wonder why? 🤔<sep>Reporter: I want you to use this word to make me happy.<br>Trudeau: hes an authoritarian.<br>Reporter: Can you please use the word dictator.<br>Trudeau: a statist.<sep>Sounds like name calling is the priority in the West I mean these are the people that can&#39;t even think independently their thinking is shaped by the media and you can identify an American comment without even looking at who wrote it cause the thinking is so limited to what the media and administration tells them its so sad.<sep>Xi is his boss. He&#39;s a jr, communist.<sep>No one takes hypocrisy seriously. Thanks to isreail all the real hypocrites are now crystal clear in the world<sep>Smart of him not to call him dictator<sep>His been bought<sep>Bought and paid for fck toy!<sep>Pot doesn’t want to call the kettle black<sep>China is more democratic than the USA and especially Canada<sep>Funny tho Usa or u Canada r u guys Democrat??? 😂😂😂<sep>Trudeau looks so much like Fidel Castro without a beard.<sep>Canada isnt a democracy either.  No country with a Prime Minister is<sep>Now...say that to his winnie the pooh chubby face.<sep>And US is two party state so what is it? Half dictatorship?<br><br>Grow up.<br><br>Democracy is defined by elections being held. It is not defined by freedoms and other nonsense. SSSR was as democratic as USA.<sep>I don’t know how you call this person in your country but I’m sure he’s not the president or someone in charge. Only a pawn or someone unstable would act like that. Very sad, Canada had so much respect from the world, now it’s just clown land<sep>This man looks like the third brother of Jake and Logan Paul. <br>And I can&#39;t trust him<sep>in this thing trudeau is right, why so many people crying in the comments?<sep>Xi Jinping also greedy😅<sep>However，your political，economic and social contribution is way worse than him. Your wasting tons of tax payer‘s money on those LGBTQIA2S+ nonsense while average Canadian are no longer afford the bill of living； The inflations，the excessed immigrant，most important，the drug problem/challenge beyond this country is booming since you legalized the marijuana……. the population of homeless people are more than the sum passed decades….. What did you did for Canada？ YOU ARE TURNING CANADA TO THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.<sep>The press dude is a pro 😂 either he calls him a dictator and he gets his headline (&quot;Canadian president calls Xi a dictator&quot;), or he doesnt call him a dictator and he still gets his headline (&quot;Canadian president refuses to call Xi a dictator&quot;)<sep>why one party state is definitely a bad thing? r Chinese banned from reading traveling living or what? leave the professional thing to the professionals please, not all people need to get involved in politics<sep>uuuhhh uhhh ueeeeehhhh<sep>what&#39;s wrong with dictators?  if he can build his country and be loved by the people and can make his people prosperous without using democracy<sep>West is all about &quot;do you call him a dictator&quot;, &quot;do you condemn Hamas&quot;, &quot;did you sanction Russia&quot; while supporting Isreal committing genocide, gg West<sep>He gets paid by china all ready been proved<sep>Justin: My moustache and salute in the past should be enough to tell you my view on this matter.<sep>Good diplomatic answer<sep>Same with India  😢😢😢<sep>So justin just confirmed that biden isnt running a democracy but a one party state ...the nuance of that simple question was obviously lost on chairman Trudeau... thankyou for the confirmation<sep>Democracy interpretation, in the way that global west do it, is the tool of modern slavery where big money run the show and all others are just pawns in the gami of vig numbers and soulless societies. Hypocrisy.<sep>I can’t stand people who bobble their head, it’s annoying.<sep>2 apples from the same tree<sep>They are owned by China, just like Adesanya<sep>Surprisingly China is not a one party state. Google it.<sep>what is holding this man upright without having a spine?<sep>Cake boy is afraid<sep>China has at least one more political party China Democratic Party which has been running campaign in Taiwan province.<br>Be knowledgeable as a politician! True Dump<sep>Don’t make him turn on his mentor!<sep>What is it with all this anti china rhetoric? Yeah so they have one party, in the west we have two parties to pick from and both work for the same cabal.<sep>Too door is a COWARD. HE PLAYS BOTH SIDES.<sep>Trudeau is Singaporean, senator<sep>He knows not to upset China 🎉<sep>Chinada<sep>Chinada<sep>Who says democracy suits all societies?! Who???<sep>Trudeau branded peacefully protesting truckers as terrorists, froze their accounts, and arrested them. But he will never say Winnie the Pooh is a dictator.<sep>Occidental democracy is nothing but a joke, Socrates and Plato knew It, obviously the milenar China knows It too.<sep>Ask him about Indian leadership... He will start spitting venom in no time 😂 what a funny guy<sep>Only truth he&#39;s ever said<sep>Democracy is such a system that it allows killing of Palestinians by Israel.<sep>Ah! trying to sabotage relationships for ideological reasons. Huge benifits right there. Much better than just going about your individual businesses.<sep>😂😂the west is a joke<sep>So sly, so slippery,  like a snake.<sep>He is getting $$$<sep>Exactly<sep>This is moter fokin dictator one of the worst! Fokin truedog<sep>This guy is really a joke.<sep>The dude forgot to take off his fake eye lashes from last nights cross dresser party. 😂😂😂😂<sep>A dictator is calling dictator to another one 😂😂😂<sep>Hahahaha do for your country like what China did. Actually we look down at you and dont consider you a state<sep>He is to affraid",0

Like I&#39;ve said many times recently, I&#39;ve never been more worried about my kids future than I am right now. It&#39;s the fault of Bidens admin not Trump. All these issues will only get worse.

But, as long as you don&#39;t &quot;fact check him&quot;, he loves you.😅 Do your homework, before you make a fool out of yourself.😮<sep>My experience.... I hated this man his whole term bc I was ignorant and didn&#39;t look at the facts. I found myself not radical enough for wokeness and even tho I don&#39;t agree with every topic I consider a republican now bc I don&#39;t identify as a open hypocrite<sep>GLORY be to GOD.☝️<br>Exactly! 71 freaken yrs.<br>PRESIDENT TRUMP, pay these American &amp; None American, DEMONS no mind. GOD&#39;S got YOU!. That&#39;s  why  YOU got THIS. Love ME some You.💙<sep>I’m voting for President Trump.<sep>Not true, Jimmy Carter did not start any war. But Trump disgraced the country by being subservient to Putin. That was the greatest insult to American dignity since Pearl Harbour. This kowtowing loosen NATO and emboldened Russia. So during the Pandemic Putin had a lot of time in his isolation to dream up plans to divert the attention of his people from the malaise and launched the invasion of Ukraine. Trump made the US and the world a more dangerous place.<sep>Other than the insurrection he tried to start...I guess attempting a civil war doesn&#39;t count...<sep>GOAT! GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP!!!!<sep>Thanks president Trump, from South Africa<sep>El señor Trump es la mejor opción !!!! Hispanos votemos por Trump !!!!!!<sep>TRUMP YOUR MY PRESIDENT! GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP I RESPECT YOU AND YOUR FIGHTING FOR US  MAY GOD PROTECT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS<sep>Trump &#39;24!!! 💯🎯❤️<sep>I mean he can&#39;t take credit for the Ukraine and Israel situation as if they were caused by Biden. They just happened to start while he wasn&#39;t in office. It&#39;d be like him winning the 2024 election and taking credit for the country being relatively covid-free.<br><br>If he had won in 2020, Russia would&#39;ve invaded Ukraine anyway, this sh*tshow with Israel and Palestine would&#39;ve started as well. The question is how would he handle it.<br><br>I&#39;ll happily praise him if he does a good job if he wins the election but if what I heard a few months ago is true, I don&#39;t think he will change anything. Putin still wants what Putin wants and Israel still wants what Israel wants. If he opposes either of these &quot;people&quot; in their attacks, he - and the USA - will be labelled as their enemy. And if he abstains from it, the attacks will continue, the situation will remain as it is, and these countries will carry on winning more power at the cost of their enemies&#39; blood.<br><br>Not that he&#39;d have to worry about Israel, since their sole concern seems to be with Palestine. But he&#39;d sure as sh*t have to worry about Russia wiping out and taking over Ukraine, then readying themselves to take the next bordering countries.<sep>Biden is proof our president is a puppet. The country is run by people behind the scenes. <br><br>FDR was physically handicapped and was kept hiden from the public. <br>JRB jr. Is mentality handcap and is being kept hiden from the public!<sep>Trump the best 👍👍👍<sep>i will say, donald trump should win, cuz he said war will not happen in his time of president. trust me, everyone is gone except the people inside their bunkers when the war starts. its also clear that donald trump is a billionaire and can buy anything he wants to, and can earn much more even without being a president which means hes not really into being president for money but to protect the earth and the humans.<sep>I’m voting for him for the third time. He is the Best President ever.<sep>People are waking  up Trump will help us out of this mess the democrats have made<sep>Fraud man<sep>when the ex supreme leader from the businessman&#39;s background......he knows war is not good for the trade market.....<sep>He did contribute to Americas Bankruptcy whilst getting rich, he destroyed his own country.<sep>The Israel problem has been happening since 1947 so yeah we did have this problem a few years ago americas just been turning a blind eye until now and all for the wrong reasons<sep>......and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening and it is scary!!!<sep>Trump is a smart man BUT it&#39;s his disrespectful nature, remember when he said AFRICANS are monkey&#39;s...such things make it hard to respect him😒<sep>Trump is abrasive but makes sense always. Vivek says the same thing in a smooth sharp way and makes sense. They would be a superb team along with Tulsi. The US really needs  them now<sep>well spoken<sep>100% right am not a American but I saw this years ago because trump say he love he country and you american call me racist but when he was president American was doing good<sep>He don’t understand foreign politics…<sep>He doesn&#39;t age ,,,<sep>The first one in 71 years who started a war inside the USA...<sep>All you Biden supporters.. you think your sooo cute.. you proud of that decision yet? America is a fucking joke right now because Joe looks and sounds like he&#39;s jumbling running this country with hearing the next bingo numbers. &quot;Chocat chocat chip, &#39;24&quot;<sep>He&#39;s very right. Real talk!<sep>They just hated Trump. It’s that simple.<sep>Im from South Africa. Wish we had him as President. Best President in the world !!!<sep>He speaks the truth. I wish we could have a President like Trump in SOUTH AFRICA.<br>After Nelson Mandela left office <br>our Presidents and the ANC is failing our country as yous.<br>All that Trump says about USA, is happening in South Africa.<br>We pray for our people amd Americans<sep>Trump 👍✌️💪💪<sep>The world needs president trump<sep>Facts!<sep>Can’t agree more.<sep>Hes letting hillary and obama  write his cards out for him😂<sep>But why he lost if he did so well...<sep>In my opinion, Mr Donald Trump is the right president for America and the world.<sep>20 To Life For Trump in 2024...😊<sep>It&#39;s scary anyone would vote for Biden again. Our country is in the worst shape I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.<sep>I dont like him but Im voting for him again .MAGA.He is a great leader i must admit<sep>Now ask Trump what he would do about Iran. I wish someone asked him already and I would love to see his answer. There are no backsies<sep>I am limited on the likes 👍 on YouTube?<sep>Incompetent leader! No.. JOE BIDENS A CRIMINAL!!!!

Cuz America is incapable of the truth!<br>He didn&#39;t do much with the war that was still killing our young men...

The Russo-Ukrainian War is something out of the US&#39;s control. You can influence all you like, but at the end of the day, nobody is truly in control.<sep>Donald Trump could be the first president to achieve peace between the Israeli and the Palestinian by dividing the historic Palestine 🇵🇸  into 2 parts as per the United Nations&#39; agreement in 1948, as so about 55% to the Israeli and about 45% to the Palestinians. And removing all firearms from all the civilians.<sep>That&#39;s the plan<sep>Truth<sep>So what war did Biden start?<sep>Imagine that there are milions in usa that still would vote for biden over trump.

I hate all school shootings, but we can save all of those kids by just saving the kid that has dark thoughts<sep>Carajo noooooooooooooo no quiero prohibir las armas de fuego noooooooooooooo yo quiero que se vendan armas de fuego siiiiii<sep>Biden president 2024<sep>FJB<sep>This is what we need<sep>🇱🇹🇲🇽🇵🇱🇲🇽💛🤍🖤❤️🇺🇸<sep>Join for us<sep>It’s not the guns,it’s the people.<sep>But you’re fine with abortion<sep>LOL..this man will go down in history as the worst president in history.

Right so why you can’t collect small guns why because your collaborat gun companies dont let you to do it.<sep>We’ve had enough, but that’s not enough<br>Getting rid of weapons from shelves will not do anything except increase violence<br>Increasing illegal activity all over <br>And cause more dangerous people to rise,<br>What needs to be done is make sure that people have minimal mental illness with programs and check ups and the ability to have a stable income. and discourage violence and oppression. That is what needs to be corrected!<sep>This is interesting. If they want to stop the loss of children but they want to nationalize abortion...how interesting...<sep>Any thing can be an assult weapon !

Trump 2024 ⚔️🇺🇸<sep>Banning guns is only going to leave our country defenseless. Criminals will come to prey on people and there won&#39;t be anyone to stop them besides the police who democrats were so desperate to defund. All of these shootings could have been deterred with guns. A ban just makes everyone more vulnerable.<sep>What about care for all the young children who are being trafficked through illegal immigrants coming over the border? Do you think about that one?

Like Don the Con even pays his bills. This alone is one of the dumbest statements from an American politician in my 73 years on this Earth. Absolutely the dumbest statement, but it does show Trump&#39;s lack of intelligence, strategic thinking or ability to lead this country.<sep>Your channel is covered with Biden not Trump.

Oh wait it happens all the time.<sep>He&#39;s a busy man and has a lot of achievements behind him. I&#39;d freeze too during an interview.

Putting him out there as their puppet of a president is elder abuse. He&#39;s clearly not all there. Shame on you networks and Jill Biden.<sep>Biden has lost his train of thought on at least several public speaking events . Probably 100 times but they don’t broadcast it.<sep>No Jill has the launch codes  not Joe elder abuse 😅clown<sep>Without a teleprompter, he just has stories that go nowhere.<sep>I believe this channel GOP is a left leaning double talk for the left.<sep>Он что засыпает ?

No longer vote after 32 years of voting mostly third party and simply don&#39;t care anymore. Nothing ever changes except I no longer recognize the country or the angry weird people all around me. It&#39;s like a cult took over.<sep>Dementia potato says what?<sep>A longer video and more context would be appropriate. Not saying he isn&#39;t senile....but, come on.<sep>deleted comment....<sep>Anyone involved with inflicting this piece of crap on the American people is a traitor.<sep>You own the guy who won with 81,000,000 votes.<sep>25th Amendment when?<br><br>They called on it for Trump for FAR LESS.<sep>💤someone💤wake💤me💤up💤the drugs💤aren&#39;t💤working💤<sep>His brain Blue Screened.<sep>this is what happens when you reject the update shit becomes slow<sep>Me lose brain? ....Why I laugh?<sep>And the media and lefties were worried about Trump&#39;s finger near the &quot;Red Button?!&quot;<sep>This man has the launch codes for the second largest nuclear arsenal on the planet.<sep>Remember when the left demanded Trump take a cognitive test? It’s almost like that was purely political lol. CLOWNS<sep>I don&#39;t fear WWIII, I pray for CWII<sep>I think after the red wave hits in November, the plan they had all along will send him packing.  Then the progressive elite will take over<sep>💬🪫<sep>Ever notice he always stares at the ground instead of the camera, so sad to watch<sep>Like him or not this isn’t a laughing matter.. shouldn’t make  fun of people like this I guarantee you all will  turn out the same way if you live to be his age .<sep>Anyone have a link to the full interview?<sep>the world sees our weakness in this old codger  as president<sep>Thats not a brain freeze, thats a stroke.<sep>If you have ever had a family member that had dementia, you know. You just know.<br>Prove me wrong.<sep>Or maybe he was just stalling for time until his handlers gave him the answer in his earpiece.<sep>the lights are on but very dim.<sep>The man&#39;s brain is swiss cheese<sep>Wow clearly something is not normal in America today!🤣🤣🤣<br>The dude is having a transient ischemic attack!  God save the republic! How can people who love him allow this to continue!  This is so evil of them! So sad<sep>He just fell asleep again.  What really looks stupid is the way he has his eyes shut all the time. That just looks sick.<sep>Wake up Brandon<sep>What a sick, pathetic joke.<sep>When a client asks me some shit I don’t have the answer to<sep>Brain dead or not he&#39;s still a fkn T R A I T O R sending billions to the people blackmailing Hunter and giving the Taliban 85 billion in weapons.<sep>meanwhile his wife pimps him around like a puppet. shes culpable<sep>&quot;COME ON MAN!&quot; &quot;look&quot;....followed by a whisper<sep>Jill Biden just uses him until he dies. Shame on her and the doctors treating him. In 2 years he won&#39;t remember he was ever the president.<sep>What kind of prescription drugs is Biden taking?  This is very evident in this video.  We need to push for answers.<sep>Elder abuse....disgusting<sep>wow.<sep>Really. Nothing. That is not normal.<sep>This piece of…..trash, we truly believe he got those 83 or was it 86 million votes…our country looks terrible with these mindless ass clowns front and center.<sep>Shame on his family for pushing the sick old cr**k<br>for running in the first place.<sep>Would actually be funny if it weren&#39;t so deadly serious. This senile fraudulent ass is putting at risk every Americans life.<sep>Joe Biden won&#39;t live three more years. He is not at an early stage of dementia. More like the middle.  They won&#39;t be showing us much more of him....he actually gave up on the thought midstream....that&#39;s dementia for sure. I think It MAY be Parkinson&#39;s but it&#39;s usually Alzheimer&#39;s. <br><br>Btw...dementia WAS the leading cause of death in Alberta. Then it was replaced by &quot;unknown causes&quot; recently. On their news stations.     <br><br>The hardest thing for a dementia patient to do when told too repeat something through an earpiece...is to repeat what was said perfectly. Earpiece communication won&#39;t be possible in 6 months I&#39;ll wager because dementia IS progressive. They can prop him up all they want with drugs but he&#39;s an OLD male and when a person has dementia they are on a CURVE towards death. A young person with dementia can have an a extended curve but an OLD man with dementia? <br><br>Joe Biden won&#39;t live three more years.<sep>My wife  has been in a home for 2 years. She talked like this three years ago. This is DEMENTIA...as plain as day to ANY neurologist. There isn&#39;t one neurologist ON THE PLANET that doesn&#39;t KNOW WHAT HE OR SHE IS LOOKING AT.<br><br>There isn&#39;t one true adult that doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s sick.<br><br>What sort of experiment are we running when the ENTIRE world KNOWS the president is a DEMENTIA PATIENT? How stupid are we?<sep>my father when the dementia got him was just like that! old Joe was never very bright but now his brain is scrambled.<sep>It is called a TIA, Transient Ischemic Attack, also known as a mini-stoke. It is what happens when the brain isn&#39;t getting enough blood, that&#39;s taking into account that there is actually a brain. 😎<sep>She... is looking like a tired 😫",0

And in 2020 was a even higher, again because of the plandemic. So yes Joe the deficit has come down each year since you became our joke of a president but that is nothing to brag about considering your deficit is still higher than when trump was president and before COVID<sep>Where is bro lips💀<sep>Joe Biden is a hypocrite<sep>Let’s look at the facts.

e580uxvdamE,You Need To Know This Fact About Easter Sunday,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e580uxvdamE,"Don&#39;t be so western centric.... The eastern churches have a different date for Easter ( though of course they don&#39;t use the English word Easter).<sep>Easter and Passover ARE THE SAME THING. In most countries Easter is actually called Pascha, aka passover. Now whether modern Jews calculate passover like Christians do, that&#39;s another issue.<sep>Except if you&#39;re Orthodox, calculations are still on the Julian calendar<sep>Happy Trans Day of Visibility. I&#39;m also comment # 666.<sep>A fake holiday for a fake occasion. How nice.<sep>Asks whether we wonder why. Foregoes to explain why and merely explains how the date is defined.<sep>no, the MARCH equinox is the march equinox regardless of Autumn or Spring.  Neil didn&#39;t say AUTUMN equionx, he said MARCH equinox.<sep>Why did it wait 1500 years to establish that?<sep>Neil looked up the year right before the video and then tries to pretend he’s just remembering<sep>Neil I’m glad you’re taking an interest in Christianity and welcome!<sep>Easter is Ishtar. Couple thousand years bce<sep>It&#39;s better to live by nature.  The sciences became abridged collusion/s forced from off campuses on/off them through hyper-additional apparent motivations with/for the breaching method/s, and/or sensing for it where/how actually it counts.  Other is being communicated for our founders in their names in our faces.  So Romulus now paces.  @StarTalk the identity of relativity/hyper-relativity is discernible.<sep>it&#39;s to remind us of everlasting💳📧🛏❤<sep>No, I don&#39;t wonder.  I know.<sep>But why is Easter in Ukraine 2024 may 5th and in the Netherlands march 23th???  Yes i am clever! hahaha.<sep>And Hebrew Calendar range of Dates? 🤔 vs Grogarian Calendar? Which Calendar used back then?<sep>Easter bunnies druids all from pagan beliefs.<sep>Talk about Antisemitic …..  the pope wrote that in the Catechism  book.<sep>Easter and Passover almost always coincide, usually a few days apart.  Several times over the past few years, the first evening of Passover has fallen on Good Friday.  However, this year, 2024, Easter and Passover are a month apart because the Hebrew calendar added a &quot;leap month&quot; this year.  Also, sometimes, in some years, Easter happens too early, say around March 25, and Passover happens in late April.<sep>Gregorian Calendar, The World 🌍 Uses it, Thanks to the Jesuits<sep>Wish he would explain when Catholics and/or Jews humanly place Passover.<sep>No, but I&#39;ve wondered how a &quot;scientist&quot; buys into gender nonsense.<sep>I wonder how many genders there are?  I wonder what the science says.<sep>I don&#39;t take grandfathers seriously. A lot of stuff in that head.<sep>Pegan Zombie Jesus day<sep>Plus fairy tales work that way.<sep>Orthodox Christians do take the date of Passover into consideration.   Pascha (Easter) must be after Passover.<sep>Really though, Easter should be during passover. The last supper was a Seder<sep>And they say Christianity isn&#39;t a cult, yet here we are looking at the lunar phases<sep>All religions are fictional 😊<sep>Religious antagonism<sep>It sounds pagan<sep>Easter or Eostre, (Goddess of spring and rebirth), is Pagan, NOT Christian.. FACT! Like most thing in the Christian religion, it was stolen.<sep>It can happen, but rarely<sep>And all that and rabbits don&#39;t lay eggs<sep>I love Mr Tyson so much. He gives us so much awesome beauty of what is the ways of the universe. If you haven&#39;t linked to star talk, do so.<sep>Why could there not be Easter and Passover on the same day? They&#39;re celebrations for two different religions, so surely it doesn&#39;t matter....why should it matter?<sep>I wonder why anyone thinks you are smart 😂<sep>what is pass over? thanks for the info, always wondered a little when to buy an egg<sep>So where does March 31st come in?<sep>You have a unique and captivating presence.<sep>just means the sun light covers on Earth has reach more than half of the Earth...the half is the equator..hence equinox<sep>Good luck explaining that to MAGA!<sep>this guys such a fraud<sep>Now tell us, how many genders are there Mr. Science guy?<sep>OK WHAT DOES EASTER &amp; BUNNY &amp; EGGS HAVE TO DO WITH THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS.  OH, I SEE, IT&#39;S ABOUT THE  CONSUMERS SPENDING MONEY<sep>because its invented for capitalism<sep>That&#39;s right Neil ... You can&#39;t have Easter and Passover , together because Easter has nothing to do with the Messiah .<br>Easter worships a pagan goddess named Ishtar , who is the goddess of fertility which is  why the Easter bunny is connected 🐇 because they multiply quickly from mating , which is why bunnies are the symbol for the goddess of fertility and the eggs dyed red form the blood of the babies born from the virgins that were impregnated and then sacrificed in a  ritual the next  spring.<sep>We recently had Easier and Passover coincide. It was just last year.<sep>Some one asked Neil if had plans for Easter<sep>Can&#39;t have Easter falling on an equality holday, either, apparently 🙄<sep>WHY can&#39;t you have Easter and Passover on the same day?<sep>It&#39;s false religion. Who cares?<sep>Oy. Neil, you&#39;re a brilliant National Treasure, but Passover is 7-8 days. Passover often overlaps with and occurs on Easter. It&#39;s also rare that the first day of Passover falls on the same day as Easter, but it does happen.<sep>And carnival is 40 days before that<sep>Its 40 days after ash Wednesday<sep>Funny thing, though; the Last Supper was a Passover Seder!<sep>Comments help. You’re welcome<sep>so is ramadan<sep>This guy just repeat info, that are available for everyone.<sep>I thought it was just r0 days from ash wednesday<sep>Great Neil.... But do you know why the orthodox Easter has a different Sunday date as the Catholic Easter? 😊<sep>Sorry, Neil. 2005, 2008, and 2016 were the only years this century where Easter and Passover DIDN&#39;T fall on the same day.<sep>And both dates for whatever are equally ridiculous !<sep>Church logic. Trust us, we know all the secrets of life and the universe but we can only pin down the actual date of Easter to within a 6 week period 😂<sep>Psalm 19:1<br>The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>And the firmament shows His handiwork.<sep>Thank you. Been wondering. I&#39;ve been told it changes bcuz leap year.<sep>pretends he was calculating 1582 lolol<sep>Jamie pull up that video of the Grizzly migrating from Easter into Passover<sep>Ah, those pagan origins slipping through there...<sep>Because Christianity is wako<sep>Why can&#39; we have Easter and Passover on the same date?<sep>Independence day isn&#39;t on the 4th of July<sep>Missed a detail: It&#39;s the ecclesiastical full moon.  Whatever that means. :-)<sep>Knowledge is a powerful thing .. even if it doesn’t fit your political spin.<sep>Bring back paganism!<sep>Another way to ensure Easter and Passover never happen on the same date is to stock dicking around with all this full moon BS, and just choose two different dates. The clue is in the build-up: Christmas and Independence Day also never happen on the same date. What luck!<sep>He&#39;s done this lecture before; THIS TIME he remembered Quadridecianism.<sep>Person: &quot;Hey Neil.. do you want to come over for Easter this year?&quot;<br><br>Neil:<sep>What would happen if Passover and Easter were on  the same day? Would the universe explode ?<sep>No, because I already know why.  I&#39;m a know-it-all like you, Neil.  The short answer is that Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring (or less ambiguously, &quot;northbound&quot;*) equinox.<br><br>* It is not sufficient to say &quot;spring&quot; equinox because the spring equinox for the northern hemisphere is the <b>autumnal</b> equinox for the southern hemisphere.  Providing the sun&#39;s heading avoids this ambiguity. 🤓<sep>In Dutch it&#39;s even a common saying when we say something&#39;s never ever gonna happen. &quot;Mom can you buy me a new Ferrari?&quot; &quot;Yea sure, when Easter and Passover fall on the same day&quot;.<sep>Never forget, this guy is anti-science<sep>It is 14 days after the &quot;&quot;spring Equinox &quot;&quot; at SUNDOWN , Passover Begings<sep>So easter uses lunar calendar, must be the chinese<sep>Hebrew calendar set up using Lunar calendar with solar corrections.<br>Constantine Catholic made sure Easter was not set by date of Jewish Pesach Passover.<br>He made it death penalty to have Hebrew calendar s.<br>Evil antisemitic dude .<sep>I adore this man! I hope he extends this out to include Ishtar , where Easter came from to begin with . Then the whole moon thing really makes sense !<sep>Thanksgiving?<sep>Just like Thanksgiving<sep>Jews actually have two formulas -- one to decide when to insert an extra month -- 7 times in a 19-year cycle; the other is a fixed length for the lunar month (accurate to about 3 seconds) to determine the new moon.  In addition to that, Passover cannot fall on Monday, Wednesday or Friday.<br><br>Note that the Spring Equinox is not accounted for; the first formula tries to approximate it, but is not bound to it.  The result is that despite the Christian effort to avoid it, Passover may still occur on the same day as Easter.<sep>Well, that’s cleared up. Now, the next thing I need to know is, what is passover?<sep>What evidence do you have of motive of not coinciding with Passover?  Passover moves as well and is also based on an older lunar calendar.  Easter adjusted to Gregorian calendar because it&#39;s more accurate.  Thought someone like you would like accuracy improvement over previous Julian calendar.<sep>I had to google what Passover is.<sep>Knowing that, easter sounds like a pagan holiday to me now!<sep>easter, as with all christian holy days, is a pagan holiday<sep>Um, Easter is the same day every year! Just not on our calendar...<sep>It’s always been believed in the Church that Christ was killed on March 25th specifically.<sep>No<sep>Persians celebrate it every year as 13 days after Persian  New Year; March 21st. It is called release of 13<sep>Muslims be like; first time? 😂 (First time hanging meme, get it?)",0

WwuE7Ca_hOY,My plan to address student loan debt focuses the benefit on middle-class and working families.,#joebiden #president #studentloandebt #democrats #democratic national committee #dnc #democraticparty #democratFollow Joe!Joe’s Twitter: https://twitter.com/joebidenJoe’s Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joebidenJoe’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joebiden#JoeBiden,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwuE7Ca_hOY,"THANK YOU DADDY JOE!!<sep>FJB AND FTG 💯!!😂😊<sep>You are a broken old man that should be in retirement not in the office.<sep>Maybe make cost of live cheaper. And then school....<sep>😂😂😂 oh Joe<sep>Everybody who voted Biden needs to be picked on<sep>You are done..<sep>Indict trump 2022<sep>When I finished college in 1994, I had 4 Federal student loans that totaled $9,000.00. When I took them out they were low 1.5 -2.0 percent interest government loans. They were sold, without notice to me, to a consolidating Student Loan Corporation and $4,700.00 dollars was just tacked on. I’m an accountant and I still don’t understand how that amount was calculated or how the sale was legally part of the terms of my original loans. <br>I can only imagine what happened to people who were encouraged to borrow part of their 4year college costs between them and now. <br><br>If student loans had been well regulated, and subjected to fair and ethical oversight, and restricted to “non-profit” entities, millions of American tax paying college graduates wouldn’t be in this situation. <br><br>I personally don’t think it’s okay for Congress to give billions in taxpayer money to Airline companies WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED, (no requirements to keep people employed, or to not give the money to shareholders,  or to pay it back), and begrudge helping students loan holders out of a situation the government duped them into. <br>It’s time to spend taxpayer money on taxpayers.<sep>… Doesn’t this man just nauseate you<br>Always babbling and talking incoherently<br>Angry yelling and screaming sheesh<sep>Please stop talking<sep>You are just an old fool<sep>President gaffe<sep>I’m confused on how he helped anyone middle class someone please inform me<sep>I&#39;m a payer!Not my loan!Why should I pay someone else&#39;s loan!Send me an explanation, I&#39;ll wait!<sep>He can barely read the teleprompter.  I paid my student loans off and now I get to pay for other&#39;s also?  Government is ALWAYS the problem.  They mess everything up and then say we will fix it<sep>Catheter or Depends at bedtime?<sep>Maybe it&#39;s time for all the people doing trades like keeping your sewage moving out from under your houses to adjust our rates to make us about $375,999 a year in a low cost of living state. About $10 million a year in New York and California.<sep>FU<sep>What about us tax payers<sep>🥜<sep>Covid raises risk of long term brain injury, large U.S. study finds. Published in Nature Medicine. Biden has had Covid Twice now...<sep>one guy works in the field as a daily worker coz he can not afford college.he works and paid taxes.<br>the other guy made a loan and pursue college education..<br>5 yrs later,biden canceled loan payment and says it fix badly broken system.😂😂<br>thats what you get when you have a career politician to lead a country,biden didn&#39;t think the system he is saying as bad is not made 4 years ago..it was there during bidens youth years.🤣🤣🤣<sep>Joe Biden lies all the time with his crusty wife and crackhead son<sep>Argh…….<sep>why do children didlers always look the same? disgusting.<sep>whyd he make it about race like he always does?<sep>Illegitimate &quot;president&quot; 😡<sep>Empty platitudes, as you further shackle the people of your country. You should hang your head in shame.<sep>US gov&#39;t has ballooned beyond constitutional limits and powers. It is now the most costly and dangerous issue facing Americans and the rest of the world.<sep>Stop paying these clowns would be best for Americans<sep>Let&#39;s Go Brandon<sep>This comment section 💀💀💀<sep>Transfers to people thet owes to people that don&#39;t  , so that&#39;s responsible?<sep>Reading these comments gives me hope and further confirms that most citizens of this country are not fooled by all the BS. Let&#39;s go BaBaBaBrandon<sep>Lies.<sep>With respect he should go home and rest.<sep>It focuses on making the rich richer at the expence on the middle class.<sep>Let&#39;s go brandon<sep>FU Biden ... im done paying fed taxes.. send ur armed IRS agents after me . See what happens<sep>He he lol<sep>The benefit of paying more in taxes yeah that’s a great benefit thanks Joe<sep>Thanks to Oblamo, college tuition skyrocketed.<sep>Nope!<sep>Okay potato head disgusting 🤮<sep>sole purpose of this is that he need votes for the mid terms election.<sep>You lie.<sep>Dude rescinded trump’s funding of hbcus on day one<sep>Biden&#39;s plan....  Take all property and control everything and everyone.  Thank You America.<sep>Your plan???  You don’t know what you are doing the plan should be resign<sep>I believe your plan is CARELESS &amp; RECKLESS<sep>😂🤣😂🤣😂<br>😂🤣😂🤣😂<br>😂🤣😂🤣😂<br>Oooh stop joey I&#39;m peeing my pants!!!<sep>Well I guess the truth will show at the elections, provided there are no more shenanigans like the last one.<sep>I believe you are incompetent<sep>How about take money from corrupt senile presidents called bigman<sep>🐔🍭<sep>Bill Gates clown 🤡<sep>Your plan is ignorant and foolish. It will solve no problems with the cost of college. Most college debt is owed by students in graduate programs. They will be your highest earners. I paid mine now pay yours.<sep>You are delusional<sep>He didn&#39;t mention people living below poverty level just middle class and working class. What about poverty ridden people who must rely on welfare and assistance?<sep>This guy is a disgrace<sep>Middle class and working families will get to pay for this plan-<br>For those of you who can apply without shame or remorse- your not the real American we need in our country- learn to hold your own accountability- you will go far<sep>If you want to know what is really going on and want facts, watch the Trump Rally tomorrow 9/3.<sep>Liar.<sep>Want a better America vote Republican 🇺🇸❤🇺🇸<sep>What are you smoking Joe. A little bit of Maryjane.<sep>Sleepy joe all your plans are trash!!!<sep>Compromised by China/protected by the Intelligence Agencies in DC<sep>Hahaha. I love satire.<br>Oh wait....Biden is serious?<br>Oh boy.<sep>10% of everything is not Fair big guy. Let&#39;s go BRANDON<sep>The system YOU BROKE!!!!<sep>You have no clue what you’re saying……<sep>It’s not student loan debt forgiveness or student loan debt cancellation. It’s student loan debt reassignment.<sep>I want future forgiven student loan just for the fun of it.<sep>America and the Americans have become humiliated, Mr. President Trump, because of this criminal left-wing party. I would have liked you to return to the presidential seat to hear your neighing as you did. I am tired of hearing Joe’s snoring, which you described as sleepy. You were right in describing him in that description, and we will not forgive the Jews for what they did to you. Always traitors to the free believers, for this China is messing with America&#39;s rear in Taiwan, and this Russia is messing with our farm and the part of the lower abdomen of America in Eastern Europe, and France is messing with the part of our farm and the part of the upper abdomen of America in Western Europe and Britain is standing grimly waiting for the zero hour for revenge<sep>Jill we need a clean up on isle 5 Joe Biden broke AMERICA, thanks Joe.<sep>FJB!!!!<sep>Alls I heard was blah blah blah inflation blah blah blah ridiculous gas prices blah blah blah War Ukraine blah blah blah Hunter Biden laptop<sep>Blow hard<sep>Not responsible, definitely not fair. Lefties are so dumb,yet they supposedly so enlightened and usually college &#39;educated&#39;<sep>Shut up!!!!!<sep>Looking into that guy&#39;s eyes are like putting your ear up to a  sea shell.<sep>Jut make sure to stay awake  while delivering<br>the statement.<sep>Joe and barrack set this system up<sep>So I get $10,000 since I paid mine off? 🤔<sep>My wallet is a Trump supporter<sep>Nobody on earth in all time has done more damage to America than Creepy Joe Biden. We know Putin likes it.<br><br>Repeal everything he asserts. <br>BTW,<br>What happened to his cancer? Was he lieing?<sep>He broke USA - no energy independence, money going to China, mishandled pandemic, increase in mental health issues, destroyed small business, crime rates are through the roof. Is there anything he done right ?<sep>He has the iq of an onion!!!<sep>Biggest disaster to hit the US.<sep>You are a badly broken system<sep>Make the schools pay for the school  loans!<sep>Democrats buying votes<sep>Trump 😇 🌎<sep>How is this fair in any way?<sep>Teleprompter Joe<sep>These liberal governments are ruining North America, and that is their plan.<sep>What about my wife who worked 3 different jobs to pay her own way through college AND graduated a year early? She broke her BACK and this uncaring machine rewarded the college students who pushed off that work for another day. Wheres her refund from your college debt forgiveness?<sep>TEXAS IS MEXICO , TEXAS IS MEXICO , YOU ARE EVIL<sep>C&#39;mon, this is Joe&#39;s channel, where are all his fans?",0

He handled himself well. This interviewer was being words I can’t use without getting a slap from You Tube.<sep>People say he is an ego maniac for behaving this way.<br>But then their response to something like this is to be super angry and start swearing or walking off or getting physical.<br>And that is what I was taught (or not taught) and that is how I react. But frankly I would have liked someone to have taught me how to assert my boundaries and still continue with the conversation after setting those boundaries if the other person understands and respects those boundaries going forward.<sep>I have to go return some video tapes now.<sep>💕<sep>I just know he&#39;s an entitled prick outside of the hollywood glam<sep>I like the way Cruise confronted this guy...it is something most of us avoid just to please everyone.<sep>That was a real war of the worlds<sep>I love the way he is when he starts schooling someone, he&#39;s not rude, he&#39;s not nasty,  he&#39;s actually polite wen they don&#39;t deserve it haha    peter, you know u are...<br>ya but..<br>PETER ...PETER TAKE RESPONSABILITY, YOU WANT TO YOU NOT OTHER PEOPLE 😂😂  LOVE IT<sep>I didnt know Tom is so calm and super smart that I want to pay a huge respect 🙏🏻<br><br>But I’m curious bout how their kids have been doing 🤔<sep>You just say yes.. <br>Ya weirdo<sep>..Приветствую..тебя..дорогой!!😏🙋💖<sep>Tom is right. Dude is getting wayyyy too nosey.<sep>Vincent mode<sep>Scientology.  Weird cult!<sep>Tom cruise is a poor pathetic useless excuse for a human being his attitude is absolutely disgusting  tom cruise is a Disgusting despicable disgrace<sep>He was planning to get married again still he didn&#39;t.why? 😅 i think he is still in love with his ex 😂😂<sep>Tom: Keep my ex-wife&#39;s name out you mouth!<sep>This is called GASLIGHTING. And Scientologists are experts at it<sep>Man he is a schmuck<sep>The real life patric bateman.<sep>You get out of line with Cruise,<br><br>he&#39;ll scold you like you&#39;re a bratty kid.<sep>Hes assertive.<sep>danke<sep>Actually for once I sympathise with Cruise here.<sep>A melhor área de membros do YouTube é aqui ❤<sep>he&#39;s a literal psycho<sep>Intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes<sep>&#39;put your manners back in&#39; is scientology talk<sep>What a jerk. Tom is a creep<sep>What was the guy even trying to get at? Was he trying to see if there was any hope that they would get back together? It&#39;s pretty silly, he&#39;s not like his therapist.<sep>He was about to use that freeze Ray<sep>She&#39;s a diva<sep>That’s a Masterclass by Tom.<sep>Everyone here in the comments brainwashed by this shady cult leader 😂 agreeing with his shitty attitude while going to other interviews and wanting to know even what atoms they breathe each second. 😂<br>I wonder how much real intelligent people are left in this world. Definitely not many in this comment section 🤦🏽‍♂️<sep>Tom is creeping controlling<sep>Can you imagine how many times interviewers ask the same question over and over. I can totally understand his demeanor.<sep>Tom is an angry little midget. 😅<sep>He&#39;s a journalist: he is asking for his readers. If he didn&#39;t have to write a report he wouldn&#39;t have to ask probing questions.<sep>Christian Bale sees beyond<sep>Is it me or Tom. Is Hella scary<sep>Manson lamps.<sep>Damn he&#39;s such an natural actor even in real life he seems like he&#39;s acting for movie 💯🔥<sep>Don’t challenge an Alpha Peter<sep>It’s the rage and seething just under the surface that makes this freaky. Pay attention to his facial expressions; The squinted eyes and pulled back narrowed lips baring his teeth (though he tried to conceal it). He looks like he wants to physically do peter harm<sep>He’s a psychopath. Always got weird vibes from him, like he’s playing at being “normal” but we all know how nuts he has to be to in the church of scientology<sep>All I can see in this interview is if Cruise were ever a cop, he’d be a bad one. He’s an AMAZING actor. Terrible human being.<sep>the interviewer is arrogant but if cruise wasn&#39;t so angry seeming he could have fielded a more even-keeled and social response without having to answer directly:<sep>Looking like dhruv rathee<sep>Gosh he&#39;s terrifying. Wouldn&#39;t want to cross him.<sep>PUT YOUR MANNERS BACK IN PETER<sep>Rare Tom W bol’s eyes literally spoke 10000000 words.<sep>Gaslighter Tom<sep>If Tom wasn&#39;t part of Scientology, he would have his own religion... no joke.<sep>It is very weird to ask someone that got a divorce if that person was the love of their live... What are you suppose to say there? <br><br>Can&#39;t say yes without sounding sad and depressed, can&#39;t say no without sounding like an asshole.<sep>I love seeing Tom stand his ground. The audacity of that interviewer was astounding. It&#39;s crazy when they treat celebrities like an object.<sep>Dont make him get his cult who believe in lizard people on you. His cult leader used to write science fiction books but they believe him about a ship coming to earth to bring them along.<sep>Tom Cruuise is actually tha man.<sep>The interviewer was using leading questions and making the interview about himself 🙄<sep>People say he’s a psycho but the interviewer definitley was out of line and just being obnoxious on purpose<sep>Good behaviour, Tom! Maybe I was misled by the media and general public opinion, that you are .... some mindless cult follower. Man, I read about Tom and watched how he behaves and all I can say is that I am seeing strong, responsible and intelligent adult. Maybe he is just the best actor ever and he is a monster and manages to put himself in another light, bit my inner feeling is that this is a good man. :)<sep>Put your manners back in!<sep>Emmely Glaser nicht<sep>Call him a Scientologist I always liked his confidence the man is a legend<sep>He is very pleasant to look at.<sep>Exactly how to neutralize BS with straight up honesty!<sep>He was being reasonable af and very affirmative, lessonss<sep>Hidden message: what do you mean peter? we are the US, we have the strongest army in the world and you are what, autralian, british? be careful with the empire peter<sep>Tom&#39;s pissed because of coarse he doesn&#39;t have a relationship with her.  She and his daughter are SPs or suppressive persons according to Scientology and are excommunicated.<sep>Tom&#39;s pissed because of coarse he doesn&#39;t have a relationship with her.  She and his daughter are SPs or suppressive persons according to Scientology and are excommunicated.<sep>Tom cruise is insane.<sep>Respect to Tom; he gave this many several opportunities to correct himself before unleashing hell.<sep>I’ve never found Tom Cruise sexier than in this video. I love his attitude.<sep>Between a shitty interviewer and a scientologist...can both of them just get fucked?<sep>He yells in the most polite way possible.<sep>God bless you love you<sep>The Scientology is leaking out into the atmosphere<sep>Don&#39;t play game peter😂<sep>Tom is so right. The interviewer stepped way over the line and he knew it. Tom has every right to answer the way he did.<sep>He looks like a psycho.<sep>Why doesnt he just admit hes gay , in this day n age , who cares !?<sep>Tom Cruise is so young !<sep>People that think Tim Cruise was being &quot;rude&quot; here is out of their mind. People think celebries are public property, and that you can ask them any number of inappropriate questions as long as you do it with a bit of a smirk. This was in 2005. Tom is promoting either Collateral or War of the Worlds because hes obligated to do so. That&#39;s what actors do. Hes not there to talk about his personal life and marriages that fell apart with a stranger<sep>Cruise is so weird.<sep>There’s nothing wrong with those questions asked. Pompous ass<sep>Great guy he says i want her to be happy! That is love.<sep>I Love Tom Cruise!<sep>ARROGANT!!!!<sep>Both men are wrong here. Peter for<br> continuously prodding Tom Cruise and Tom for being atrogant and a narcissist. He could have easily told peter that he isnt comfortable answering about his personal life or could have excused himself and walked out.<sep>And Peter never was the same after this interview 🤣😂<sep>Tom you are right👍👍👍<sep>You know… Tom Cruise was fair and polite considering he was pissed….<sep>Everytime this clip has been shown they chop the crap out of it and they never show how inappropriate the interviewer comes Tom was right on the money to say that I don&#39;t think anybody else would have they would have gotten up stormed out and that would have been it and at the end of that interview Tom thanks and then said I think it was great in this guy goes you think it was great to go see I thought it was a good interview I really have come to respect him I don&#39;t want to know any more about his personal life cuz I don&#39;t want to judge him I don&#39;t want him to judge my personalized he puts his life on the line to entertain people every single day he should be applauded and respected for that Steven Spielberg said flat-out Tom Cruise saved Hollywood<br>I&#39;m going to respect him for his professional attributes cuz he&#39;s awesome his personal life is none of my business<sep>Ethan😅😅<sep>if i learn how to do this<br>i&#39;ll b at peace of mind.<br>and society will b a better place",0

zWsRaHn776M,‘Sham’ or ‘solution?’ Senators divided on Mayorkas trial,Republicans and Democrats weigh in on whether the Senate should hold a full impeachment trial for DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqKFollow us:Twitter: https://twitter.com/washingtonpostInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/washingtonpost/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsRaHn776M,"It&#39;s Trumps fault when he left the White house he took the MAGIC WAND MEMBER? OBUMER.<sep>When did the law,Constitution, or any other legal rights mean anything to Josh Hawley? Instead of the Senate, by the way he ran from the insurrectionists,he displayed great running skills. But first, he needs to see if he has a flawed memory condition since he totally pushed that event from his mind and disregarded the feces left,which clearly shows that this was a peaceful event of real patriots. Only the portion of the electorate that put him in office is more despicable.<sep>The bill is about money for OTHER BORDERS! THIS BRAINLESS PRESIDENT COULD STOP THE BORDER BLEED AS FAST AS TRUMP DID!!! STROKE OF A PEN, NOT A NEW BILL!!<sep>Chicken Josh.<sep>This whole horseshit with Mayorkas is nothing but a republican cover up a for their inability to do anything for the American people such as passing immigration bill. Why did they not pass an immigration bill because Donald Trump told them not to.   They are spineless weak useless men and women in Congress to bend down to a man with judge called a rapist what is disgrace the Republican party has become<sep>The bill for the border is a waste of money and none of that money will be spent on the border!!!! That&#39;s why Republicans don&#39;t want it.  Plus if the Democrats wanted to clean up the border all Biden has to do is close it down like it was when Trump was in office!!!!!<sep>Democrats have become habitually delusional liars malicious and slanderous race baiting hate filled, slurs, snare share liars ...<br>Sick, sick sick all the way unto eternity, so so very sad...<sep>Also says “Congress Shall count the votes [electoral votes]”, but Hawley, as always, he disregarded that part and side with Trump to toss them out. Amazing how he thinks he can just pick and chose parts of the constitution he agrees or disagreed with.<sep>In this day and age, it doesn&#39;t matter whether you ademocrat or Republican if you are A.<br> Politician.  You are a criminal. End of story.<sep>His job is to keep people out and he&#39;s done the opposite !<br>The democratic are efen trash !!!<sep>Why is he acting like he&#39;s sharing a secret that&#39;s creepy as hell<sep>These people are useless except for the first one<sep>It is a sham! Gop voted against the border bill. There is no misdemeanors or high crimes, this is a policy dispute. The house gop needs to get over themselves and do some work for the good of the people.<sep>Are all Democrats POS liars?<sep>Watching from UK one thing is crystal clear. This republican run house is a joke. The Republicans aren&#39;t doing anything useful for your country.<br>They could have had more border guards already except the orange clown said no and congress republicans followed his lead... despite getting EVERYTHING  they asked for. A sham trial by a sham party. When the USA takes its blinkers off and looks at what this congress has achieved verse every other congress in history your country might just do something about it.<br>A complete joke. I can see it from the other side of the pond.<br>I&#39;m not invested in either party so can see this without partisanship.<br>Keep supporting them and you&#39;ll never get anything done.<br>Sorry, my mistake, they harmed the military and almost shut the government.<sep>All U are the synagogue of Satan<sep>Democrats fucked up the border and blame republicans.   Um ya.  Sure<sep>Democrats should get off their A**as and get on with the trial.  They wouldn&#39;t have sent the impeachment to the Senate, now get off the damn butts and DO YOUR JOBS.<sep>Mayorkas is a corrupt traitor selling the invasion of the USA.  Impeach him or you will be next once Trump gets back in the White House and cleans house of the useless and corrupt democrats<sep>But we know the Democratic Senate WILL NOT impeach the criminal.<sep>If it was bipartisan, it wouldnt be voted for on party lines.<sep>The laws are already on the books. The republicans do not have to pass any law. This administration is NOT enforcing the law.<sep>Go to the border yourself and see the evidence<sep>And when will you charge Biden and Lloyd and all other dipshits for warcrimes??<sep>If you are charged with enforcing laws and refuse to enforce those laws you appear to be guilty of that failure, and that is a crime.<sep>&quot;If Republicans would get off their asses and pass a law ...&quot;  Laughable, considering Dems stopped building the wall that would have brought the problem down to a trickle.<sep>Govt action at work.😂<sep>Nothing will ever happen.<sep>They are being too kind. It should be a trial for treason.<sep>It&#39;ll be funny to watch democrats let Mayorkas get away with high treason. Trump just keeps winning, and there&#39;s no stopping him. What&#39;s the penalty for treason? Please remind me.<sep>So the House Republicans have made a sham out of this process and now they want the Senate Republicans to go along with it. Great colleagues 😊",0

He does stand-up, and of course Blackadder!<sep>For someone who&#39;s known to play a character who is really dumb, rowan is pretty smart in contrast.<sep>У мистера нет родителей крупных землевладельцев, мистер Бин не учился в одном классе с будущим премьер- министром.Мистера Бина не приглашали на королевские свадьбы. <br>Кастовость британского общества и снобизм верхних по отношению к нижним от Роуэна Аткинсона.<sep>Blackadder is Atkinson&#39;s best and most iconic character. Mr. Bean pales by comparison.<sep>This guy can replace David Attenborough on the nature documentary&#39;s<sep>Rip<sep>and when you play a child character at first, at that time it seems fun to you and when you mature and see how you acted That&#39;s when you say &quot;what a performance that was, I did exaggerate a lot&quot; and here we see it reflected,Rowan is not entirely satisfied with his role as Mr. Bean, it is even the worst role he ever played.<sep>I like his voice<sep>He might not be nice but he&#39;s still our childhood<sep>No he didn’t mean that, I know how much Mr Bean is a narcissist but that’s just his weird character and he does have his nice moments so not “exaggerating” weird for the most part<sep>It&#39;s mindblowing to know that Rowan and Bean are the same person. They should redo the whole Mr Bean series once again keeping the storyline unchanged, but this time, instead of Bean, it would be Rowan in the Brown suit. That&#39;d be awesome.<sep>Hello mr bean<sep>Wait wait WHAT THE F***K BMW☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️<sep>Technically....its Mr BEAM not Mr bean. Every episode he would appear from a light in the sky. He was odd bc he wasn&#39;t human, came from a planet of &quot;Mr beams&quot;. He was weird bc he was learning how to be human.<sep>Lengend<sep>U look so alike with Mr bean<sep>Love him 😂<sep>genius man👏<sep>But we like Mr.Bean a lot❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉<sep>I&#39;m of the opinion that his 2007 iteration of Mr. Bean was handled well. He may have not been the brightest still, but at least he had courtesy that time around.<sep>I said this before in another video/short but Mr. Bean is an alternate personality.<sep>He&#39;s an alternate personality.<sep>I&#39;m a friend mr bean<sep>Absolutely.   Hero<sep>So your saying you think your odd and wierd and not nice?<sep>❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Blackadder is also kind of like that. Perhaps these characters represent the id, while Atkinson&#39;s rather advanced superego keeps that side of his personality in check.<sep>That’s why he stopped acting. Well, at least he isn’t dead<sep>This is the character &quot;Mr Bean&quot; which made Rowan Atkinson famous 😢<sep>Me gustan mucho sus videos<sep>Might be it 😮 your illustration but that was too close for spectator s<sep>A wise man once said &quot;never forget your roots&quot; and for that he ain&#39;t doing much good.<sep>Mr Bean and the fun Mr ❤❤<sep>How perfect! That he could do what he does not like without fail! I want to be like him!<sep>Qué agradable sujeto eres, Rowan<br>😏👌🏼<sep>yo hes got waves<sep>One of the best genuine actors<sep>But for me, he the most likely same character like me😂<sep>😂😂😂<sep>I get it lol rowan said he was weird and odd😂😂😂<sep>❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>Well, this is the exact situation what happened Santiago Segura with Torrente<sep>❤❤❤❤<sep>That&#39;s mister bean he looks like one<sep>Then why did you create him, Mr. Atkinson?<sep>Dang mr.bean good at acting, i dont think ive ever heard him talk<sep>when did we actually met Rowan A? was it in Belgium or France  or worst Luxembourg? It&#39;s known my french is very bad; i t kind of always was; ask filmmaker  A.

Dark Adder is far worse and is not even funny.<sep>i love all of your videos mr bean<sep>😂😂😂Were sorry mr bean<sep>I can only think of Rowan Atkinson&#39;s performance in 2012 Olympic Game.<sep>Yep, he&#39;s very egoistic and sometimes very harsh, but because he&#39;s weird and not very healthy person, we can find him funny.<sep>Always be happy Mr bean♥️♥️♥️<sep>did he die?<sep>Ffgh<sep>Just a quick reminder about it for me this weekend to get the job you want to take care about the job you were not at the end 🔚 and you can 🥫 it and you will have the opportunity to make it to me as well if you&#39;re<sep>Like 👍<sep>Rowan Atkinson: I&#39;m Done With Mr. Bean Beacose I Don&#39;t Like Him At All And He&#39;s Very Odd And He Looks Pretty Weird And He&#39;s Not Very Nice Guy!<sep>I don&#39;t like him but he made me 60 millions 😂😂😂<sep>Mr. Bean is a legend character and the charming is he doesn&#39;t speak, that make him global.

He&#39;s a Legend.<sep>I think he meant he like Mr bean more than himself<sep>I love Rowan Atkinsons characters, especially Mr Bean ❤❤❤<sep>He is very nice i like him",0

In all fairness though she could be the president, she’s that lucid. So all I said was “well not everyone in their 80s is as lucid as you!” I left it at that lol it’s an ‘agree to disagree’ type of situation as far as I’m concerned because I’m not looking to hurt anyone’s feelings. She’s extremely emotionally invested in politics. It makes it hard for me to be genuine about it😅 So here I am left with nothing but ranting into the void on the Internet to strangers🎉<sep>What a shame!

Trump 2020 freedom fighter!<sep>He is just a talking head not to be trusted at all<sep>I&#39;m not American and I graduated over 20 years ago - but this is still inspirational to me.  Thank you<sep>Omg it’s Hussein😊, he used to love using ak47s !<sep>selena gomez<sep>Dear Mr. President I really miss your leadership I’m not American but the world miss you. Yes America go through slavery , civil war economic depression world wars and get back stronger . Question is do America will survive another 4 years with Trump? As I said I’m not American but I wish I hope that Americans will vote and restore the American dream the America I admire , the respected America.<sep>Kinda sad that this isnt getting many veiws<sep>Did he just say &quot;our democracy&quot;. Im not even into politics and I know we arent a democracy lmao<sep>What a boob!  LOL!<sep>The kid is cool! Obama is a total blockhead.<sep>Total marxist gasbag<sep>Had your chance hush up<sep>Says the man that didn&#39;t do anything but enjoys taxpayer money.<sep>There’s some crazy lunatics in this comment section<sep>Thanks Obama<sep>Aahhh, finally, words of an actually wise person.

AN OREO COOKIE<sep>Thank you Obama way to go!<sep>Just listen to this man and think about it 🙏🏻<sep>You are e Killer 😡👎<sep>Deep State 👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡you are a ...........😡👎👎👎👎<sep>The rich will never allow this happen. So young kids, don&#39;t bother trying to change the world. Lol!! What we can do is work hard, work on things we feel strongly about, stay close knit with your family. United States and countries like China have clearly leveraged COVID 19 and made it a billion dollar business. Capitalism is not the way forward.<sep>The American comment sections on their coronavirus news reports are so positive. Compared to the British ones..<sep>Better graduation speech compared to my graduation<sep>OBAMA YOOOOOO<sep>Miss you Obama 🥺💞<sep>Obama is a pizza lover<sep>Graduating Students Beware!  <br>This man you all praise and love and wish a 3rd term for is a COWARD and a TRAITOR to the United States of America.  He is a charlatan and an empty suit.  You students being addressed don&#39;t even know his &quot;history&quot; as president because it has been hidden from you by the press and mainstream media.  You are being duped. Here is a little &quot;history&quot; of his presidency:  <br>China - During the last two years of his administration he allowed China to triple its investments in the USA.  Biden was his &quot;front man&quot; for this and they both made millions while thousands and thousands of job got shipped to China.  He did NOTHING for those displaced workers. <br>Iran - Paid them off with our taxpayer dollars with pallets of cash.  They turned around and spit in our face and chanted &quot;Death to America&quot;.  He then did NOTHING. <br>North Korea - He did NOTHING to stand up to Kim Jong UN as he threatened us with nuclear annihilation.  <br>Russia - He did NOTHING when Russia annexed the Crimea from Ukraine.  Putin knew he would stand down because he told Putin he would.  <br>Benghazi - He did NOTHING to help our ambassador and staff who were killed like dogs in the street.  He did NOTHING to retaliate.  Then he let Clinton take the blame for it.  She deserved it though.  <br>Syria - After saying he &quot;drew a line in the sand against the use of chemical weapons&quot;.  Syria used them and he did NOTHING.<br>His legacy is full of NOTHING.  Your&#39;s will be too if you follow this man&#39;s lead.<sep>Why doesn&#39;t the little SOB just come clean about the abuse of office he oversaw as president?<sep>Thanks obama<sep>Obama is proof that affirmative action doesn’t work!<sep>I love this<sep>WE DID IT! WE ACTUALLY GRADUATED! WE WILL ALL GET THROUGH THIS STRONGER<sep>Sorry something about taking holidays in Spain. Thank You all welcome Spain<sep>Good morning from Vasco Country. The floor is very sticky. Sorry disturbing<sep>Come back sir<sep>44 FTW drop the 🎤🔥🔥<sep>Michael and I 🤭<sep>Who does this piece of garbage think he is?<br>    ABSOLUTELY NOBODY SOLICITED his stupid opinion!<br>He attacks Trump because he is COMPLETELY envious and jealous of PRESIDENT TRUMP&#39;S UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS!!<br>AND THAT HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN 8 YEARS!!<br>HEY YOU SATANIST, SHUT UP AND GO PLAY IN TRAFFIC!!<sep>B.O. is still smug and arrogant - he&#39;ll never grow<sep>Love the video!<sep>Shut your corrupt and screwed up hypocritical mouth . You are part of the evil sniveling swamp ...We now know your handlings and they will be unraveled.<sep>Gate<sep>To the brain dead people who believe this pack of useless bull.this so call man is nothing more then a evil and dishonest being.he is going down in history as a liar and a dangerous moron.president Trump won&#39;t stop until Obama is shown in the true light.this guy has no right to talk about a virus.he is one.<sep>piss off you Globalist twat  , we rejected you and your fellow Loonys and pedophiles<br>Heard your wife is a man<sep>“If the world is gonna get better, it‘s gonna be up to you “.  <br>This is exactly what Chairman Mao told young people in 1950s . No doubt,  they both are Marxists and liar .<sep>Thank you President Obama for this great historic speach.<sep>Obama is corrupt. Acting likely everything is a-ok. As so many people have lost their livlihoods he come on tv with this - talking about concern for global warming. Some people are in food lines trying to just eat and he&#39;s concerned about global warming. What a scumbag.<sep>.........<sep>We should be seeing more of YOU because you just lost 2 seats 😁 &amp; my Hispanic daughter is 22 and a student at Dominican University in the Bay Area California and she IS NOT VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS 🤑<sep>This Obama commence was So stupid I’m glad my daughter wasn’t watching it because all he talked about was politics, Keep your personal stuff to yourself and should’ve kept it professional and inspirational 😝”Unbelievable “!<sep>These inequalities and racial disparities are very strange. They disappeared for 8 years (2008-2016) and then reappeared. It&#39;s as if a miracle happened.<sep>This guy never took an Econ class<sep>This no go for nothing bad example of a human being.he is a false face Lia and he will have to answer for his evil ways.the worst president in history.<sep>obama....what a Joke...I Don&#39;t Care BO<sep>Creepy New World Order speech<sep>Mr Obama, go home, to your rich home. Obamagate soon.<sep>Who in the hell would listen to this bonehead Obummer...worst President ever<sep>Stop dividing American barry soetoro!!<sep>This just shows what a complete arrogant moron Obama is.  Way to use what was supposed to be about GRADUATES and stealing THEIR special day to invite your own agenda. Biggest Jerk ever!!!😡😡😡<sep>Read &#39;Animal Farm&#39; kids.<sep>Stil. Classy and  handsome!  We love you and your still America’s President!!!<sep>President Obama: Best POTUS since JFK.<sep>really miss President Obama.  He may not have done everything that everyone wanted, but I can tell you one thing that I&#39;m almost 100% certain about:  First, President Obama would have NEVER fired his Global Pandemic Response Team (as Trump did in 2018 after passing legislation and giving 2 trillion dollars of tax cuts to millionaires and corporations). President Obama took his oath of commitment in protecting the safety of all American citizens very seriously.  As nearly everyone would agree, I&#39;m 101% certain he would have responded to this pandemic back in January, possibly avoiding the amount of deaths in America. There&#39;s no doubt about it.  For now, we must deal with the corruption and greed of the man-child sitting in a wet diaper who calls himself a president.  It&#39;s so depressing.",0

There is nothing in the Constitution that mentions abortion; that is why the Supreme Court had made the determination each of our 50 States had to determine their own law in regards to abortion. Biden is nothing more then a constant big lie. Remember when he said he was going to pay for everyone’s college loan? Remember when he said he would stop inflation and high food prices? That is right he didn’t.  But you must remember when he said he was going to the border and he would stop Fentanyl and Terrorist from coming into the U.S.  Of course he never had plans to protect us from invaders from the south whom I imagine were taking their marching orders from Iran.

What’s more, 18% of the majority of American voters who believe Trump should be held criminally accountable for attempting to overturn the 2020 election said they would vote for Trump anyway.  That’s how bad President Bozo is doing in the eyes of the American People!!<sep>Hey Joe, would it hurt you to tell the truth, once in a while?<sep>And biden took money out of the US postal service pension fund to give it to Ukraine.   Look it up<sep>I&#39;ve never seen people just outright lie like these Democrats can<sep>It’s not on the the ballot. SS is not an entitlement we paid into it. When Biden was a senator he voted to move SS funds into the budget for congress to spend. He’s responsible for SS money not being there. They to restructure the SS do that we can choose to opt out if we want to.<sep>Big liar<sep>I think it&#39;s odd that Biden can claim to be protecting our social security from those bad Republicans when he as a senator tried to sunset social security not just once but eight failed attempts. There&#39;s even video of him talking about it.<sep>While you were a senator you voted to raise the SS retirement age. You’re a liar<sep>LIAR<sep>Liar<sep>DEFAULT<sep>Although there are a couple radical republicans in congress that are on the record for saying they want to cut SS or Medicare, that doesn’t mean the Right wants to as a collective.  Just another political tactic by the slimy Left.<sep>I will Vote 🗳 👍<sep>Trump said  US first and Biden said Ukraine first 😂😂😂😂😂😂<sep>Like I said<sep>Invasion of privacy since 2017 using me for its own financial gain consumer fraud and so much more! They are going to have some major major lawsuits on there hands<sep>This platform is getting sued<sep>Shut up Joe you liar.<sep>We made a lot of progress to give trumps oil plant to Russia and putin and putin wanted more oil and since Ukraine is such a big oil spot they started a war with Ukraine for the country and not to mention inflation and gas prices and the gas prices are high because of the oil plant gave to putin so bassicly what I am saying is this guy is running America into the ground because he made gas prices hight + started the Ukraine war, now I am still wondering why people used dead peoples names to vote for this dumb idiot, So I just have a question for all the people who voted for him after reading this, Are you happy for voting for him now?? 😔<sep>He’s a liar using parts of sound clips <br><br>WhT an idiot<sep>Liar, liar pants on fire<sep>Hey didn&#39;t you try and take away 4 times. I saw the video.<sep>The amount of context cut out here is staggering<sep>Brandon Pinocchio is impressed with your @&amp;)%#¥£<sep>Slide over joe, RFK Jr 2024<sep>Biden Administration LYING Again. Biden when a Senator tried to Introduce a bill to try and get rid of Social Security, Medicare and Medicad because he thought it was a waste of money to give to people.

He hasn&#39;t done anything except destroy America and Americans!<sep>Senile disgrace to America<sep>Lies<sep>Spaghetti<sep>I don&#39;t believe this. What they will do is cut social security funding to illegal aliens. Is that why he&#39;s up there?<sep>He sent the nation in to brokenness<sep>Sleepy joe<sep>Don&#39;t sound crazy to me.👏<sep>One more thing . . . When you do well in America and have a retirement income that is relatively high, you get to pay a monthly surcharge for your Medicare Part B and Rx Coverage.  For me, it&#39;s over $500 per month.  I sure feel &quot;entitled&quot; to be contributing more per month in retirement than I did while I was working.<sep>Since when are programs I&#39;ve contributed to for decades an &quot;entitlement&quot;?  Let&#39;s be clear on this - throughout my working life I pre-paid for the benefits I am receiving now that I am retired.<sep>If it Democrats mouth is moving it&#39;s a lie Trump 2024<sep>If you care so much, why did you pass that bill to tax our social security check,  when it&#39;s the only income some of us senior citizens have?😢<sep>Pyramid system for the Indian 🇮🇳 and Chinese 🇨🇳 immigrants <br>Over 6 000 000 Chinese + Indian immigrants in 2022 .

F9HcLxl4XOg,Jeff Bezos - One of the first orders from Amazon in 1995 was from Bulgaria [HQ],"Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon.com and the richest man in the world, mentions funny story about the most interesting order via the web site in the first 6 months. The video is from 25th November 2002full presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2xGBlT0cqY&t=",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9HcLxl4XOg,"It was made from Blagoevgrad, by AUBG students :)<sep>Where can I find the full video?<sep>Actually putting money inside a floppy disk was a way to hide it from the scanners so they cant detect it. Anyway … funny… the life was much easier and simplier than today. 😊<sep>Is that Simon Sinek at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9HcLxl4XOg&amp;t=55"">0:55</a>?<sep>This is the most bulgarian thing I&#39;ve ever heard 😂<sep>It might be people today who haven&#39;t seen a floppy disk.<sep>He&#39;s got a sweet, kind essence. I absolutely wonder how and where he&#39;s traveled spiritually and through the planetary magnetic guidance system. Idc how ego inflated he seems bc he still isn&#39;t. In higher tiered realms he&#39;s absolutely not and experiencing it is absolutely gratifying. Not sure what that scary energy is AI produced but my intuition tells me she&#39;s not real and discarded. Doubt he&#39;d ever show up so garbage and trashy with a plastic mangled barbie unless his destined pathway willed her ugly frequency. Yucky. He&#39;s got a voice that is very calming and engulfing in beautifully kind frequencies. Put a diaper on Jeff as well as that hyper indulging flake. Lol watch out for the Hammer and the STD from sweetie pie Lauren lol<sep>Back in the days when Bezos was (or at least so it seems) actually a likeable character unlike the demon possessed monster he is now.<sep>Българи юнаци .<sep>He should have known that at that time Bulgarian programming students were siphoning off funds from credit cards around the world, so he should be happy he received his payment cash!<sep>I think your title is misleading... Bezos said &quot;In the first few months we got one order from Bulgaria...&quot; this doesn&#39;t mean it is the first order ever at Amazon<sep>My country &lt;3<sep>We invented computers pal and you assumed we don&#39;t have internet huh?<sep>HEY I AM FROM BULGARIA,YOU BALD ASSHOLE!<sep>Why are Americans sooooo Ignorant about the rest of the world 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<sep>Money has changed him.<sep>The first computer is maded by a Bulgarian you id*ot...<sep>My mom was offered a job at Amazon when she was little in Bulgaria if she accepted we would be rich<sep><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9HcLxl4XOg&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> the guy on the bottom left is currently CEO of Amazon<sep>So he got the money?

I had to sent some money somewhere and they gave me precise instructions on how to “hide” the money 😂😂<sep>As a Bulgarian I can relate. Pure Tarikatluk<sep>That&#39;s use to be normal in eastern Europe to hide money in worthless objects to mail it. I use to send hundreds of dollars rolled up and stuffed in the spine of an old book through the Post. The x-ray machines can&#39;t see it<sep>Jeffy baby you have nothing since all you have is inside you...<sep>It so Balkan, nothing is changes to this dates.<sep>Im the one that ordered those books and they never showed up. I&#39;m still dealing w customer service...<sep>It was the first order of amazone after 6 months??<sep>Yes america was<br>Discovered in 16 century and in Bulgaria you have the oldest churches in the worlds from 7 and 8 century.. so pls..<sep>Woah. This makes me love my country even more :D<sep>A story doesn&#39;t get more Bulgarian than that :D<sep>Never seen this before. Makes me feel so proud! :)<sep>Ha ha, great story! Now you can&#39;t say anything against the Bulgarian&#39;s innovation minds :)<sep>Bezos left his loyal Bulgarian customers :(<sep>Nothing is true, everything it&#39;s permitted.<br><br>He sayed this thing about a romanian, now, he says it about a bulgarian...wtf<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnSjKTW28qE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnSjKTW28qE&amp;feature=emb_logo</a><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9HcLxl4XOg&amp;t=670"">11:10</a> starts from there<sep>Ah if it wasn&#39;t for us he wouldn&#39;t be richer than our own country<sep>Lol.

What man literally starts a company to put all the pregnant women and single mothers with children in the trucks at the peak of every summer, while the men be at pack stations? Jeff Bezos does. 😘🌮<br><br>Enjoy your day, everyone!<sep>Wow<br>This order was my friend Kaloyan Ganchev, paying in cash, a method of payment discouraged in 1995, was from Bulgaria. He lived in Sofia, and was 7 years old, he owns a gym now and likes to make his muscles stronger and stronger every minute. Kaloyan ordered barbells from amazon so that he could be strong man.<sep>When you are high position every Cock and bull story seems a damn truth..!!<sep>I’ve been to Sofia Bulgaria last year and I had an awesome experience.

It goes something like this. <br><br><br>Around Christmas time, a bunch of mailmen are opening peoples mail to see if it has anything good in it. They open up a letter to Santa which says <br><br><br>&quot;Dear Santa, my family doesn&#39;t have much and we&#39;re barely getting by, but all I want is some mittens, a hat and a sweater so I can be warm during the winter Love Ivailo&quot;<br><br><br>The mailmen tear up, they pool their money together and manage to buy a pair of mittens and a sweater, but not enough for a hat. They then send them to this poor kid to say it&#39;s from Santa. A few weeks later, they are opening mail again, and find this kid wrote back to Santa. The letter said:<br><br><br>&quot;Dear Santa, thanks for the mittens, hat and the sweater. I know you also sent a hat but those bastards at the postal service probably stole it, thanks!&quot;<sep>thing u instantly realize is Jeff&#39;s been bald for a long time and hairloss never took away his confidence<sep>Floppy disk should be a widely accepted payment method.<sep>This guy is banging Lauren Sanchez right now on a Yacht in Venice.<sep>He is from Greece..<sep>I like short videos and to the point.<sep>For an April Fools prank Amazon should have the floppy disk pay option<sep>Лайкнете коментара, че да си помислят чужденците че казвам нещо много умно плс :D<sep>f him, He created hell for sellers even though it is the sellers that made him to where he is now!

Dr. Evil is a Lorne impersonation, and by extension this is Lorne speaking and giving his thoughts on the situation. And he is doubling down on the message of &quot;nothing sacred in comedy&quot; by doing it in a way that makes fun of himself.<sep>Great impression but the writing is so fucking bad<sep>He didn&#39;t even say freakin&#39; once... what a missed freakin&#39; opportunity. Clearly he needed Scott in the room to have a go at for not being evil enough... well, I guess he created Robot Chicken. Maybe he&#39;s climbed the ladder to the Coke with Stevia level of evil...

Not to mention allowing children to get hormonal stoppers and championing gender reassignment surgery for minors. I&#39;ll give you one guess what party those individuals vote for.<br>Now both of those are pure evil.<sep>Love guru was one of my favorite Mike Meyers movies.. shame other people didnt wanna help there uncle jack off and elephant.<sep>When Dr Evil is literally just his Lorne impression 😂<sep>Mike Myers Dr.Evil character does not look right without those clear blue eyes.

Personally, a childhood classic. <br>&quot;If you&#39;re Uncle Jack helped you get off of an elephant,<br>would you help your Uncle Jack off an elephant?&quot; Shit kills me to this day 💀😂<sep>The world needs Dr. Evil<sep>Dr evil for president<sep>That was actually funny, Jesus dude didn&#39;t think he could still make me laugh<sep>Called it an Uber.

Vì một việc quá căng thẳng hiện nay. Dạ thưa tình hình khí hậu hiện nay thật nguy hiểm báo động đến nhân sinh toàn thế giới. Gây nhân quả khổ cực cho nền kinh tế. Thưa bác, cô, chú , anh chị em. Em suy nghĩ nếu nước mình vẫn tiếp tục sai lầm trong bảo về tài nguyên và môi trường thì đồng tiền việt nam sẽ mất giá trị và những nước có cách sống, cách suy nghĩ tiên tiến, sẽ đánh giá nước mình là sống thiếu suy nghĩ, thiếu tôn trọng chính mình. Bão lụt, hiểm họa động đất. Biến đổi khí hậu. Gây đau thương cho loài người và tự nhiên. Nhân quả đấy phần lớn là do loài người tạo nên. Nếu có một ngày người dân phải gánh chịu hậu quả bão điện nhiệt phân tử. Làm vòng quay trái đất sai hướng, động đất, lũ lụt, hư hại đồ điện tử, biến đổi gen hậu quả thật sợ. Đấy là cơ hội cho những nhóm lợi ích, nhóm chống đối, phản động, tin tặc, gây bất hòa nội bộ trong nước và thế giới. Làm hành trình tìm kiếm trái đất thứ 2 gặp bất lợi. Dạ thưa bác, cô, chú, anh chị em. Người khổ nhất vẫn là người dân ạ. Em mơ ước có một ngày. Mỗi nhà đều có một máy làm thực phẩm từ nấm gọi là thực phẩm thay thịt không béo như nước Anh, không còn lo đói nữa. Đi du lịch khắp nơi. Cùng chung lời nói. Chung tay làm việc. Cùng loài người, những tổ chức Bảo vệ tài nguyên và môi trường sống bền vững của trái đất. Phát triển đa dạng sinh học, lưu giữ, nhân giống những nguồn gen quý. Trả lại cho sinh vật ngôi nhà vốn có. Em có suy nghĩ nước mình nên dùng 1 nhà mạng ạ. Em thích nhất là nhà mạng viễn thông quân đội VIETTEL. Em rất thương bác Lê Minh Hoan. Thuộc hội đồng họ Lê Viêt Nam. Đại Biểu Quốc Hội. Giám đốc ngân hàng phát triển nông thôn AgriBank. Bộ trưởng bộ nông nghiệp và phát triển nông thôn. Quản lý, định hướng, phát triển nông nghiệp và lâm nghiệp việt nam. Dưới quyết định của Quốc Hội, Chủ Tịch nước và những cơ quan có thẩm quyền khác. Bác Lê Minh Hoan được tín nhiệm 2 năm 333 ngày trôi qua. Con rất thương bác, cây cao gặp gió lớn ạ. Lỡ liên quan đến tham nhũng thì rất nguy hiễm ạ..... Con mong bác trước tình thế hiện nay. Luôn có suy nghĩ riêng của mình và mong Bác sớm nhận được thông tin số liệu mới nhất đến từ những tổ chức vì môi trường sống và trái đất. Đặc biệt là tổ chức khí tượng thế giới và liên đoàn thiên văn thế giới. Dành riêng cho công việc trồng rừng. Giúp ổn định, cân bằng khí hậu. Bảo vệ vi khuẩn lam tạo oxi trước nhiệt độ cao. Con nghĩ dù là người nào, ở đâu, trên trái đất này, vẫn luôn nhớ thương. Luôn mong ước vòng tròn tuần hoàn khí hậu trái đất ổn định bền vững. Luôn muốn Gặp mặt trao đổi trực tiếp. Cùng tìm hướng giải quyết tốt đẹp nhất. Em xin Anh, Chị cảnh sát môi trường cần điều tra vụ việc. Những người đưa cây keo vào trồng và trồng trên diên tích rộng. Nếu cây keo thật sự có lợi cho sinh vật và trái đất thì thật tốt ạ. Nhưng nếu cây keo có hại cho nhân sinh, nhân quả đối với loài người, sinh vật, trái đất. Vậy thì những người liên quan cần xin lỗi người dân và toàn thế giới. Việc này nếu không giải quyết nhanh sẽ khó xin vốn của cơ quan, tổ chức, doanh nghiệp, trong và ngoài nước. Công người lao động trồng rừng sẽ giảm. Tình trạng nợ công thêm nặng, khó giải quyết. Tại sao không chồng cây khác ạ. Cây keo tích nước và chất nhiều nên nhanh lớn nhưng cây keo làm hại môi trường quá đáng sợ. Lá keo có màng lá bao bọc bên ngoài dầy, cứng, có thể bẽ hoặc xé lá để biết kết quả ngay. Vậy nên lỗ khí khổng trao đổi khí kém ít tạo ra oxi. Trong lá và võ cây có chất độc nếu dụng xuống nước cá không lớn được. Lá keo, cành keo, võ keo đốt cháy khi người dân khai thác song gây bẩn khí quyển tạo mưa axit. Lá keo rụng xuống cỏ không mọc được. Cây keo hút cạn khô chất dinh dưỡng từ đất. Trồng cây keo trong lúc chờ cây lớn gây sói mòn đất, xạt lỡ đất. Tại sao không trồng cây cao su kết hợp sen canh cây khác. Chờ cây cao su lớn, gỗ cao su khai thác cũng tốt. Hay là trồng cây gỗ nhẹ nhanh lớn giống cây balsa của Châu Phi, thêm vào phụ phẩm nông nghiệp, lâm nghiệp và ít chất hóa học tạo thành đất, thành đá làm nhiên liệu xây dựng đường giao thông. Xây dựng lại những ngọn núi đẹp mê hồn người. Vì phát triển phục vụ loài người mà chúng ta bắt buộc phải khai thác. Làm lệch vòng xoay của trái đất. Cuối cùng em xin chúc bác, cô, chú, anh chị em. Thật nhiều sức khỏe. Để phục vụ đất nước mình. Em xin cô, bác, anh chị em, chia sẽ bài viết của em. Để những người liên quan trong việc này tìm được hướng giải quyết tốt nhất ạ. Và chúng ta cùng chung tay làm việc. Bảo vệ tài nguyên, bảo vệ môi trường sống của loài người và sinh vật. Bảo vệ trái đất trước nguy hiểm biến đổi khí hậu do loài người tạo ra.<sep>1.

You have a talent for that🤓<sep>It’s already like watching a terrible ballet ..<sep>🥗🥗🥗🥗 😂<sep>Why do vegans love Led Zeppelin? Because it&#39;s &quot;Plant&quot; based!<sep>what do you call an astrophysicist that changes his career to being a comedian? Retired.<sep>Must be a USA thing...<sep>Lmao. I love this guy<sep>Is that NFL or college football?<sep>❤<sep>Not an NFL game, it&#39;s a College Bowl. Let Chuck do the Comedy, Neil. Love Ya!<sep>Its a shame he lost all credibility for himself by passing cooment on biology as a physicist. rule 101.  I cant watch him and take him seriously now.  i will watvh him for a beginners explanation to any new confusing physics projects.  Hes a master at that.  But real credibility/integrity now objectively has has now really gone.  RIP Always gonna be great for the basics.  Real depth and credibility, now we have to dig deeper. Luckily  Im well up for that!! :-)<sep>Wah, waaaaaaaaah.<sep>This one threw me🥴<sep>Ouch<sep>That’s a great granddad joke if I ever heard one<sep>DANG😂😂<sep>I saw this while eating a salad bowl<sep>Dad joke! <br>In college we were the worst flag football team- bottom of the standings.<br>We played the second worst team in the TOILET BOWL!!!😂😂<sep>Man growners<sep>😂<sep>Not funny. Let comedians tell a joke.<sep>Forgot the rim shot<sep>Exactly. Lol<sep>That is about as funny as my jokes.<sep>what wha whaaaaaaaaaa<sep>I&#39;m a sucker for a corny dad joke 😂<sep>Why do physicists have such a hard time seasoning their food? <br><br>Because thyme is relative<sep>😂😂 that was a cute joke<sep>Damn!

Because you can’t make an nfl team with all the vegetarians in the NFL. Let alone 2 of them.. lol. Jk. I have no idea how many vegetarians there are in the nfl. But a team is 53 players. So you’re talking 106 to have a game. I mean bare minimum you would only need 11 on each team. But they wouldn’t be very good. Probably need at least 33. You’ll need 5 linemen, Qb, RB, FB, 2WR, TE. Then about 5 back ups. Like an extra 2 WR, TE, RB, lineman. Then on defense you’ll have 3/4 linemen and 3/4 linebackers 2 cornerbacks and 2 safety’s. Plus 5 or so back ups. LB, lineman, 2 cornerback and safety. Then you need a good kicker.. Something like that. Idk. I doubt there’s many vegetarians outside kicker, QB, and maybe DBs and WRs could get away with being vegetarian. Vegetarians eat eggs right? Lots of eggs… lol.<sep>Um<sep>Come on dad, spice up that joke! 😂<sep>Today we have Jokes with Neil<sep>Did he not dye his hair.  Or &quot;&quot;&quot;eepfak&quot;&quot;&quot;<sep>Only Neil video I&#39;ve disliked<sep>Please please pick my question<br>    If someone is on the equator and travel towards the North Pole why didn&#39;t he feel inertia since he was travelling faster at the equator then the pole?<br>    Please pick my question ❤️❤️❤️<sep>😆🏈🫶🏼<sep>😅<sep>Ha ha ha😂<sep>If u ain’t rocking Arcteryx as a scientist idk what u doing.<sep>Neil, that waa a terrible JOKE.

But if you make more money than him( if he win) you have to pay more taxes.<sep>PERIODT ✨😻👁️👄👁️<sep>Systemic racism. Without racism they would have no platform. They are the ones perpetuating and nurturing the idea to further their political causes. Racism is another excuse used by victim mentality masses. Do something for yourself. This is America....there&#39;s nothing to hold you back. (IF YOU&#39;RE WILLING TO WORK?)<sep>BIden is a befuddled sluring old corrupt fool<sep>joe bidementia, the corrupt lying hypocrite.<sep>Love fron the netherlands!<sep>&quot;10% for the big guy&quot;..........i think Joe will do well to get 10% of the vote after everyone wakes up to the fact that the Biden family has received millions in secret dealings with the Chinese communist party controlled entities, 3.5 million from Russian Oligarchs, and millions from Ukraine which Joe Biden threatened with retaliation if they didn&#39;t fire the prosecutor investigating Biden corruption.<br>  Don&#39;t let the democrat owned mainstream media brainwash you...........Democracy v woke, violent, sjw, socialism......you decide.<sep>BIDEN. KAMALA. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏<sep>Trump 2020<sep>Yes<sep>It&#39;s so comforting to know that America will once again have a president who can speak coherently and in complete intelligent sentences. Vote Blue all across the Board to save America.<sep>iam voting for trump because joe biden looses him memory like this the 20 the 20 uhhmmm thousand<sep>wow did he wake up after 47 years of slumber , with millions from china? since he has not done anything else in 47 years,but line his and his familys pockets, and smelling children<sep>He&#39;s like Sid from the movie Big Daddy. He has a 4 year plan. It&#39;s to bad that he won&#39;t tell you what his plan is. Its most likely that he doesn&#39;t even have one<sep>ah the closing statement, this is when he read the scripts smoothly<sep>🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸<sep>Trump 2020<sep>Biden 2020 in a nursing home<sep>Successful candidate<sep>I got hairy legs!  🍊 man =red wave!<sep>Go get your diaper changed Joe!

He had close ties with Robert Byrd, a former KKK &quot;Exalted Cyclops&quot;. In fact, Biden gave a eulogy for him in 2010, during his first term as VP. He voted against desegregation in the late 70&#39;s and also passed the 1994 crime bill that disproportionately impacted black men.  Found it odd it never gets brought up.<sep>Biden For GITMO 2020<sep>You’ll choose to sell America out again!<sep>They are turning off the comments on all their videos what are they scare of???😂😂😂<sep>You must be president to regain all. Clean energy. My late husband died thinking about it and I haven&#39;t received any his pension in 6 years because I live in Mexico<sep>Joe Biden’s voters sure do seem to be appealed to quotes. Quotes and actions are two totally different things, don’t be so gullible.<sep>Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lies<sep>Sounds prepared. Very artificial. Prepared speech.  Meaning question was leaked. Biden was pre-coached.  Shame!<sep>&quot;Hope over fear&quot;?! All he does is instill fear and hopelessness on to people to begin with. He brings up the 200k deaths from the virus time after time, talking bout people having empty chairs at the table,talking bout having more shutdowns,wearing masks everywhere at all times HOW IS THAT &quot;HOPE&quot;<sep>I don&#39;t mean to get political but where&#39;s kanye?<sep>The platform is more important that the candidate.  The track record is more important than the promises.  Biden&#39;s platform calls for taxes, regulations, and open borders.  Biden&#39;s 47 years in public office is a record of failure to deliver on multiple campaign promises.  His mental condition does not look promising.<sep>Trump 2020<sep>When Joe created a youtube account to make some extra money<sep>Those 1.04 minutes would be more than enough to convince me to vote for Biden If I had the chance...<sep>TRUMP 2020<sep>Decency, honor and treating people with respect? You&#39;re nothing out of them Joe. You are just an angry racist man. Look back at your comments. By the way increased agression is the early symptom of dimentia<sep>America and the world don&#39;t need your Coronavirus Agenda...<sep>You lost...<sep>Explain your family’s dishonor and disgusting acts. It is Gross and illegal activity . I would call it Mr Swamp goes back to Washington<sep>Terrible!<br>Landslide loss coming up.<sep>come on...<sep>Iam Joe Biden and I just forgot my name. Who am I?<sep>Biden is a liar, scam and cheat. Joe Biden the Big Guy and Hunter Biden the Bag Man have been taking corrupted bribery money from China and Russia for years<sep>I love you both<sep>Trump&#39;s closing statement was truly the worst!<sep>I want  Joe Biden  To    WIN 😆😁👩‍🦰👩🏻‍🦰👩🏼‍🦰👩🏽‍🦰👩🏾‍🦰👩🏿‍🦰👱👱🏻👱🏼👱🏽👱🏾👱🏿👨‍🦲👨🏻‍🦲<sep>Sorry Joe but it was a rough night for you.<sep>Trump 2020<sep>Joe Biden the type of guy to accidentally vote for Trump because he thought he was voting Trump out<sep>&quot;We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter FRAUD organization in the history of American politics.&quot; - Joe Biden<sep>Joe biden for president😊😊😊😊😊😊 from manila philippines😀😀😀😀<sep>China Joe does represent China.<sep>Almost 50 years in DC and nothing to show for it... Obama took far too long to endorse or campaign for him.. that is a BAD sign.. President Trump is the lesser of the two evils..<sep>So today I watched a Biden rally and you could hear crickets in the background it was so boring. First he had his wife get up and talk and then he got up and spoke. He’s all alone up on the podium and he’s wearing a mask and he’s outdoors. There is nobody anywhere’s near him. They quickly showed the people that showed up and it was pitiful what a small crowd he had.  then I listened to two trump rallies today. And he had at least 2000  to 3000 people show up for his rallies. He didn’t wear a mask but he’s on the podium by himself outdoors but the people in the crowd were wearing masks that said Trump on them. And the crowd went crazy screaming “four more years four more years  or “trump 2020 trump 2020 “or “we love you we love you.  They were cheering when somebody had a drum that they kept hitting and it was such a huge difference between a Trump rally and Biden rally.<sep>So powerful.<sep>Yo Biden why don&#39;t you show the clip of you saying that you would transition from the oil industry????<sep>Who built the cages Joe?<sep>MABA- Make America Biden Again!!! Vote Biden 2020!!<sep>In Australia, the former opposition leader tried to sell the idea of electric cars and charging stations all over the country.  He got scuppered with one question; how long does it take to charge a car fully?  He dumbly said 8 mins.  Dude, it takes 8 hours. You&#39;d need to stay overnight and pay for a hotel or sleep in yr car.  Will there be enough charging stations, or will you need to queue up for days to get yr turn?  Or will it be like Wells Fargo days and you swap cars at a relay point when yrs can&#39;t run anymore?  Fantasyland.<sep>&quot;All men and women created... by.. go... you know.. the... you the know the... thing!&quot; - My Chairman<sep>Biden&#39;s inaugural statement below:<br><br>I got hairy legs that stand up when I&#39;m at the pool, and kids like sitting on my lap. Also, don&#39;t worry, after 47 years of doing nothing, I&#39;m actually going to do something this time.<sep>Biden did a wonderful job reaching out to everyone very Presidential.<sep>He puts me to sleep<sep>“We’re gonna move” just go back to Africa<sep>&quot;I never had financial relations with that country&quot; - Hunter Biden<sep>Trump 2020<sep>Pay to play is the Bidens crime game.🇨🇳 , 🇺🇦<sep>Victory is certain 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙<sep>Im the &quot;Big Guy&quot; now and China will control me because they have paid me well over the years is the bit you missed out Joe.",0

If you come to this decision, you will certainly fail of obtaining everlasting life. The impossibility lies in your own will. <b>If you will not, then you cannot overcome.</b> The real difficulty arises from the corruption of an unsanctified heart, and an unwillingness to submit to the control of God. <br><br>Many whom God has qualified to do excellent work accomplish very little, because they attempt little. Thousands pass through life as if they had no definite object for which to live, no standard to reach. Such will obtain a reward proportionate to their works. <br><br><b>Remember that you will never reach a higher standard than you yourself set. Then set your mark high, and step by step, even though it be by painful effort, by self-denial and sacrifice, ascend the whole length of the ladder of progress. Let nothing hinder you. Fate has not woven its meshes about any human being so firmly that he need remain helpless and in uncertainty. Opposing circumstances should create a firm determination to overcome them. The breaking down of one barrier will give greater ability and courage to go forward. Press with determination in the right direction, and circumstances will be your helpers, not your hindrances.</b> <br><br>Be ambitious, for the Master&#39;s glory, to cultivate every grace of character. In every phase of your character building you are to please God. This you may do; for Enoch pleased Him though living in a degenerate age. And there are Enochs in this our day. <br><br>Stand like Daniel, that faithful statesman, a man whom no temptation could corrupt. Do not disappoint Him who so loved you that He gave His own life to cancel your sins. He says, <b>“Without Me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5).</b> Remember this. If you have made mistakes, you certainly gain a victory if you see these mistakes and regard them as beacons of warning. Thus you turn defeat into victory, disappointing the enemy and honoring your Redeemer.<br>—Christ&#39;s Object Lessons, 331, 332. <br><br>Your time, your influence, your capabilities, your skill—all must be accounted for to Him who gives all.... Persevere in the work that you have begun, until you gain victory after victory. Educate yourselves for a purpose. Keep in view the highest standard, that you may accomplish greater and still greater good, thus reflecting the glory of God.<br>—The Youths’ Instructor, <br>January 25, 1910, par. 14 <br><br>From Reflecting Christ - Page 299<sep>Hi Arnold I’m a big fan<sep>God<sep>Arnold is one of the coolest, funniest, strongest, and smartest people on this platform<sep>I love you❤<sep>He&#39;s just the best ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>You know you it’s my inspired for the body building maybe never be you but you continue inspiration to me ( sorry for my bad English) 💪💪<sep>sou seu fã ARNOLD moro no Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷<sep>just saw the &#39;protein&#39; &#39;schnapps&#39; smoothie-ish video about getting protein in the fastest way possible and I &#39;dated&#39; someone who majored in fitness or what have you at Univ. of Delaware and he had all kinds of &#39;protein&#39; references.

Marcher sans les conflits de toutes sortes qui n&#39;ont pas lieu d&#39;être et qui ne font que retarder les grands projets humanistes de Créativité dont l&#39;unique objectif étant de travailler par échanges des projets communs ou indépendants selon des règles de bases uniformes pour éviter le blocages et déséquilibres et surtout les débordements et etc...Qu&#39;en pensez-vous ?

Vive l&#39; Ukraine, vive la France, vive LES Républiques ! ✌🏻🇺🇦💪🏻🥰🇪🇺🇨🇵<sep>Envoyer des armes pour renforcer l esprit de guerre et de faire plus des victimes et plus de ravages en Ukraine ou en Russie. Et  apres ils disent On est la pour la paix Voila ce que c est l OTAN  .OTAN c est une  Bande de cyniques qui font des ravages dans le monde entier . Président Poutin il a lancé des offensives millitares a cause de politiciens comme Macron. Et raconter des menconges et faire du n importe quoi en comprenant rien dans les conflits Ca c est Macron. Macron c est le plus pourris président de la France Il y en avat pas aussi pourris que Macron . Macron il vaut même pas 1 cheveux de Poutine.Macron c est un gros merdier pour la France et Europe<sep>Cet homme est dangereux et contre l avis des autres pays europeens , tout seul . Vraiment méprisable . L europe a besoin de  paix . Pas d une brebis galleuse qui joue les tromblions avec Poutine pour tenter en vain de glorifier son egocentrisme incomensurable et lache .<sep>Tu a oublié un truc ... tes problèmes<sep>Elle touche qui cette guerre apart toi et jean michel trogneux 🫡<sep>On veux sortir de l’Europe<sep>Cest toi qui fait chier  a poutine , tu as deja remplit la poche de velencky , esque ce nest pas assez  tu débrouille  la caisse des francais pour l&#39;Ukraine  , et maintenant  tu veux faire la guerre  pour envoyer  nos enfants  ce tuer , mais tu n&#39;as  aucune pitier pour nos enfants   si tu  avait même  deux enfants  tu comprendrais mas les bourriques ne fon t pas d&#39;enfants..<sep>Mon ce n&#39;est- pas notre guerres  tu as que de haine  pour le peuple français<sep>ce nest pas ma guere<sep>METS TON CASQUE ET VAS CONVOLER EN NOCES AVEC TA ZELENSKY !<sep>Premièrement poutine se défend face a l&#39;OTAN qui veut faire rentrer lukraine, si l&#39;Ukraine entre dans l&#39;OTAN et récupére la Crimée par des moyens militaires ça risque d&#39;être très problématique, la Russie ne veut pas de missile a leur frontière, vous n&#39;avez pas respecté les accords faut assumer, deuxièmement ce n&#39;est pas notre guerre<sep>Notre ennemi c&#39;est l&#39;homo poudré de l&#39;elysee,  s&#39;il pouvait se prendre une bastos dans sa tronche de traite.<sep>Demander la paix ne le fera pas arrêter mais bien dit sinon<sep>Au niveau du faciès du regard des dents …..on voit la franchise l honnêteté  : 0 !! C est visqueux . On enlève le son et on regarde que l<br>Image …. Un sketch surjoue !<sep>c&#39;est toi qui menace<sep>Bravo  tu est un président   fier de son pays  ..ci on fais la troisième guerre  et bien on as pas le choix  veaux se réveiller  Cris<sep>Venez le chercher les russes<sep>Napoleon !! :DD_D<sep>Ce monsieur est énervé. Son visage montre comme il retient sa rage . Je ne vois pas de hauteur, cette hauteur qui doit être celle d&#39;un homme état. Et qui plus est quand on occupe la plus haute fonction de cet état .<br>Je vois de la colère, de la rage. Des choses qu&#39;on ne voyait chez bon nombre de nos anciens chef d état, qui prenait le temps de réfléchir .<br>L esprit de défaite n&#39;est pas incarné par cette guerre.<br>Mais au contraire par une politique qui n&#39;a apporté de solutions au court des 7 dernières années, et qui a vendu, et divisé ce pays comme jamais .<br>Alors bien-sûr quand on a plus de solution, il reste la stratégie de la peur pour imposer les choses, car après tout une bonne guerre rien de tel pour faire oublier les déboires d&#39;un pays et se donner de la crédibilité.<br>Alors oui, nous sommes en guerre, une guerre interne, une guerre civile. Une guerre entre ceux qui vendent, et détruisent notre pays au profit d intérêts extérieurs. Et la majorité silencieuse qui lutte pour défendre vraiment ce pays .<br>Je ne vois pas chez ce monsieur un chef d état .<br>Juste un homme sans solution devant ce qui est devant lui, en train de satisfaire sa vendetta personnel.<br>Navré ce n&#39;est pas ma guerre. Pas pour cet homme, pas pour ce que ce pays est en train de devenir .<br>Grosse pensée a toutes les familles qui souffrent ne serait ce que pour faire leurs courses, payer leurs factures, nourrir leurs enfants. Et cumuler 2 voir 3 boulots pour ça, et qui n&#39;y arrive même pas . C&#39;est gens la sont en guerre tous les jours pour leurs survies. Comme nos agriculteurs , nos artisans . Oui eux aussi sont en guerre pour leur survie . <br>Mais cette guerre la, on a pas de solution pour elle, alors elle va sous le tapis rouge.<sep>Macron est un danger pour la planète entiere. <br>Ce type est nuisible.<sep>La France aime toujours se mêler qui ne regarde pas Tu ments Macron Oui la Russie a attaqué l&#39;Ukraine soi disant car les médias français contrôlé par toi je n&#39;y crois pas et Poutine ne veut pas faire la guerre à l&#39;Europe entière il veut l&#39;Ukraine c&#39;est tout Tu ments Macron Vas y toi même car les français ne veulent pas mourir pour un dictateur français comme toi Tu es pire que Benyamin Netanahyu  !!!! Ty veux tuer tout le monde Tu t&#39;en fous des français car tu sais toi même que la France veut ta démission depuis 2017 et encore maintenant Tais toi et démissionne !!!!<sep>Moi je pense que c&#39;est pas notre guerre mais la tienne plutôt désolé hein<sep>Macron en 1ere ligne !

Most on going highway project of India excluding North East will be completed within few years. Government could spend more money on other sectors. Like: Education. <br><br><b>Education:</b> Central Government has introduced <b>new Education Policy</b> after Independence. Students will learn Coding from school itself? Students will get complementary marks for their performance on sports, arts, Yoga, Acting, Singing etc? Many IIT, IIM and other premium Education institution has opened in last 10 years. Many Central Government run Schools has opened in last 10 years. <br><br><b>India is blessed to have 3 dynamic Ministers. Ashwini Vaishnaw, Dr S Jaishankar and Nitin Gadkari Sir.</b><br><br>Jyotiraditya M. Scindia is also good. Recently TATA and Indigo has ordered about 1000 new Aeroplane. The number of operational airports in the country has increased to 148 in 2023.<br><br>Upcoming Vande Bharat Express could go upto 240 Kmph. There will be multiple new Semi Fast Train would come as <b>Vande Bharat Express, Vande Metro and Vande Sleeper.</b> Government should focus on High Speed Sleeper Train and improvement of Railway Tracks. Presently Railway Tracks are not suitable for High Speed Trains. Hopefully in future India could export Vande Bharat Trains to other countries also. <b>Presently Government has ordered about 300+ new Trains.</b> It was unfortunate that previous Government had ignored giving order of new Trains. <br><br>There was only one AIIMS in Delhi during previous regime. Patna AIIMS was also started by Atal Ji. <b>But now almost 20+ New AIIMS is under construction stage.</b><br><br><b>Border Infrastructure:</b> Neighbouring States of Tibet (China controlled) like Kashmir and North East gets huge Infrastructure boost. Probably Arunachal Pradesh will get three national highways — the Frontier Highway, the Trans-Arunachal Highway and the East-West Industrial Corridor Highway. It will help both people and Indian Army. It&#39;s very important for Country&#39;s security. Note : If Government do spending on North East, Kashmir, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Orissa and others then <b>companies of Southern and Western States get benefited. More profit for business means More Tax for the State and more Job creation.</b><br><br><b>Kashmir:</b> How could we forget Kashmir. It was Hell on earth. Students can&#39;t go to School because Stone Pelting, Business was on very bad situation in J&amp;K. Attack on soldiers everyday. Ladakh and Jammu was affected by dirty politics of Kashmir valley&#39;s family based parties? But now everyday School is running smoothly. Tourism is at high point. Mega Infrastructure project is going on. Vande Bharat will reach Srinagar probably within few months. <br><br>Production Linked Incentive Scheme has been done awesome Job to bring lots of Investment which resulted creation of new Jobs. Electronic manufacturing has gone up. Apple is investing in India. Semi conductor manufacturing units are coming. <br><br><b>Green Energy:</b> Central Government has decided to give free and clean (Non polluted) Electricity to People of India. PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana 2024 (Free Rooftop Solar Unit). Solar Rooftop will also give free energy to electric vehicle and free energy on electric induction stove for cooking. Government has invested hugely on Ethanol, Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydrogen. The cost of Solar Production has also come down. Hydrogen is the future, Government has already announced its Hydrogen policy. It will help India to cut down cost of Oil and Gas Import and it will be helpful for Environment. Hopefully in future India will export Hydrogen Energy to other countries.<br><br><b>Historic decision:</b> Women Reservation. Banning Triple Talaq, Article 370, Support Ram Mandir movement. Creation of Ministry of Jal Shakti for Tap water. Water is a state subject but now center will help States.<br><br><b>Internet Revolution:</b> India has become highest consumer of Data consumption in the World. Internet has developed huge Job opportunities. Youtuber, Instagram, Ola, Uber, Homestay, Food based business, Other self employed works etc. Even Modi critics gets Job because of Modi ji&#39;s good work.<br><br><b>Indian economy is going fast.</b> That&#39;s why probably almost every State Government has announced more and more politically motivated <b>free beneficiary Scheme or promoting Revdi culture?</b> Karnataka government has probably announced about 60000 crore/year free new beneficiary Scheme. They have also running old freebies Schemes along with new one. Look at the freebies of Punjab Government, Delhi Government, West Bengal Government, Assam Government, Tamilnadu Government, Telengana Government, Kerala Government etc. <br><br><b>Attack on Media and Journalist</b> by Opposition Parties is very concerning. Recently Opposition alliance has declared to boycott Journalist who don&#39;t accept slavery of Dynasty Politics? When Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar was in power in Maharashtra, they took action against Arnab and his team of Republic to create fear? If Arnab had done something wrong then only Arnab and senior members of Republic should be punished but why to disturb others. With the help of Dynasty Politician of Bihar Dynasty Politician of Tamilnadu had sent Manish Khasyap to Jail? It&#39;s OK if Manish Khasyap had done something wrong, he should be punished. But Tamilnadu Government uses India&#39;s one of the Costliest Lawyer Kapil Sibal Sir against a tiny Youtuber. They could have used other talented Lawyer against a tiny Youtuber but why they had used Kapil Sibal Sir who is also fighting against Government of India on behalf of Dynasty Politician of Kashmir (Article 370). Ask yourself. <br><br><b>Attack on Sanatan and spreading hatred is really concerning?</b> Thol. Thirumavalavan (DMK allies), Udhayanidhi Stalin (DMK), A. Raja (DMK), Rajendra Pal Gautam (AAP), Swami Prasad Maurya (Ex Samajwadi Party), Kirti Chidambaram (Congress), Priyank Kharge (Congress), Jagdanand Singh (RJD), Chandra Shekhar (RJD)??<br><br>You should know most important Mandirs are Government controlled but No Church or No Masjid or No Gurudwara is being under Government controlled or politically controlled. So Muslim organization and Christian organization like Missionaries are financially &amp; politically powerful. They can easily do more social work. <br><br>Opposition probably wanted to divide people based on Caste, Religion and Region? Example: Some leaders told Indian Muslims that they will lose citizenship if CAA would be implemented. Which was a lie. Probably they wanted to disturb communal harmony of India and blame it on to Ruling Party. <br><br><b>Muslim:</b> People should ask for RTI report on Muslims. Muslims gets highest benifits from Central Schemes. House, Toilet, Scholarship, Education etc. Almost No Riots in UP. Crime Rate or Mafia Influence has come down in UP. Shockingly Muslims are start liking Yogi Government. No School Bandh/Close due to Stone Pelting in Kashmir. New Medical College, IIT&#39;s are in construction in Kashmir. Vande Bharat will reach Kashmir by this year. Almost all Muslim countries (excluding Communist Chinese supporter) has good relationship with India. Saudi Arabia had conducted Yoga Camp. UAE has given land to build Temple. <br><br><b>Global Power:</b> India&#39;s global power has rapidly increased in Global arena. Global leaders do give importance to PM and present Foreign Minister. This Election is very important for both China and West Powers. They don&#39;t want powerful Government in India, they want weak puppet Government in India. <b>Microsoft has warned that China is gearing up to disrupt the upcoming elections in India.</b><br><br>Note: Please verify and analyze the above arguments by yourself. If you want to double check the data, you can do it. Please take screenshots and share it as much as possible.
