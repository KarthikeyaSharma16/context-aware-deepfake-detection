TyrHqJdgU7w,Trump puts on heavy French accent to mock Emmanuel Macron,"Donald Trump mocked French President Emmanuel Macron by imitating his accent as he recounted a phone call on tax negotiations during his presidency.According to Mr Trump, he threatened Mr Macron to put a 100 per cent tariff on wines and champagne imported from France to the US if the French did not remove the 25 per cent tax they were planning to slap on US companies operating in Mexico.Mr Trump also mimicked US President Joe Biden, who he is likely to face in a general election rematch in November.Trump is in Iowa to curry support ahead of the state's Republican caucus on Jan 15, which is the first contest of the Republican presidential nominating contest.Subscribe to The Telegraph with our special offer: just £1 for 3 months.

Our sun went 7 times bright for 7 days as a universal, visual trumpet for the &quot;kick-off&quot;, of Revelation, on this planet. Lord Jesus is the Christ said in John 5 or 6, others I have, not of this fold, and I must bring them, even Moses in whom ye trust. Now if we don&#39;t try to hurt them, they are in &quot;show and tell&quot;, mode, we can, could learn an awful lot of helpful , beneficial, still our Lords&#39;, things from them, which I am for, and agree with, actually? But all things, even Aliens, only in and through Lord Jesus is the Christ, of course please? As you found out, demonic is, are a problem, and that&#39;s&#39; why? Same with asking God Jehovah anything, must be done in or through Lord Jesus name or satan, demons will intercept it, mess it up, you may have known or remember that, again, that&#39;s why, please? Thank you all for your work though, may God save, heal, and bless, all, only in and through Lord Jesus is the Christs&#39; name forever please, you all have my permission? Love, sincerely Duane, Amen?

It&#39;s already legal in the state of Illinois and about 14 other states<sep>Hi trump<sep>Apartheid.<sep>Has it occurred to anyone that maybe this happened because homeless shelters have been homeless peoples&#39; legal addresses since the year before the last election? Where did all those Mail-In Ballots get mailed to?  Blue States may have rewarded them for their votes by standing back &amp; standing down ... overthrown by the homeless. The entire state&#39;s counties may have voted red but were electorially outvoted by the city limits where the shelters were located.<sep>Remember when Hanoi Jane Fonda fell in love with the N Korean leader and saluted their generals?

I can not count how many times they have spoken about the issues behind the administrative and higher up corruption.

Its amazing!!<br><br>I used to follow mainstream BS and believe it.<br><br>I am truly sorry and now love this man.<br><br>What did i do - i listened to him.<sep>Thank you President Trump. Agenda 47 ! Let’s go! Love you DJT!<sep>can we just like pay people more so they dont have to be homeless?<sep>So, the central premise of Agenda 45 was to give huge tax breaks to the already wealthy in America, which resulted in further entrenching socio-economic divisions in America and exacerbating issues like homelessness, addiction, racism, and other forms of bigotry. That means Agenda 47 is an attempt to impose authoritarian order to the chaos generated by the same people who are proposing to fix it  now by inhumanitarian means. No thankss.<sep>An overly simple short term solution to a rather complex long term problem? Definitely sounds like Trump&#39;s modus operandi and his sheeps are eating it up, apperently without a single critical thoughts thereof. <br><br>For a while I lived on or near the site of one of the little known pre  KZ concentration camps. It was a small camp built to house Romani people that was arrested  or &quot;voluntary&quot; got relocated there when they cleaned up the streets of Berlin before the Olympics was held there. There were no barbed wire fences and guard towers with machine guns there, but those inside the camp were forbidden to leave the perimeter. They had toilets, water facilities and a school. Sure, there were only two toilets for over 800 people, only three water taps and just one teacher -but the increasing squalor and runaways proved how problematic the Romani&#39;s was. It went down hill on a slippery slope from there toward  KZ camps and then &quot;the final solution&quot;<sep>An actual plan and it sounds sensible. They should make this guy president.<sep>We need to bring back state institutions. When they were closed, this problem started to rise<sep>So many elderly fall into the soon-to-be-homeless category!  We have PRIDE!  and DIGNITY!  We also have alcohol and pain med addictions!  Money (via Biden-omics!!) can NOT fix it -- but President Trump has real answers!  God bless President Trump for standing firm for the American People!  Now it&#39;s up to US to get him back in office!  Vote wisely!!  🙏🙏🙏<sep>Mr Trump. I would just like to say I&#39;m not a voter,  but only because I want to make it through this life without needing to rely on anyone else. I do want to let you know that if I did vote, I would have voted for you because first of all you are the only person that myself and most of America knew who you were before you became president. You also actually did do what you told the American people you would do. As for all of this BS that you are going through at  this time I believe is a pretty hypocritical thing for them to do. I mean if it&#39;s anything to do with taxes, they have a lot of room to talk. The IRS has owed me a little over $4,000.00 for going on three years now. I&#39;ve been broke for about the past year now but I still will not ask for any benefits from the government. I would  like to see you get out of this and back in to office. Good luck to you Sir.<sep>I love president TRUMP ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<sep>The establishment=swamp=dems=rep=ind=unions do not want to end all this. Instead, they seek to disrupt and divide America from within. To rid the American Heartland of God, Family and Home. This is the reason for the massive influx of illegal immigrants to build sanctuary cities. So small blue dots can elect corrupt politicians verse an all-red state deciding who they choose. What America needs is to live by the Holy Bible and Jesus Christ and what he did on the cross for human kind.<sep>In california they should&#39;ve never approved prop 36.

Instead of helping them, they have passed out free drugs and needles, tolerate their criminal activity etc but harvest their votes.    Deny homeless the right to vote for five years and the problem will be solved.   Homeless is a for sure vote for Democrats to harvest.    🇺🇸<sep>🇺🇸. Biden and Kamala want Americans to give up their guns; yet they condone prosecutors and courts to release criminals from prison.    Kamala bailed out criminals from jail so they could continue to burn cities.   They need to be voted out and jailed.🇺🇸<sep>🇺🇸. Biden, and his Team and Corrupt Democrat Politicians can not buy Latino Votes with drugs, needles, sex changes, food stamps, college tuition, visas etc.   LATINO VOTE IS NOT FOR SALE.   BIDEN HAS COMPROMISED HIMSELF AND SOLD AMERICA AND ITS NATURAL RESOURCES TO CHINA AND TO CRIMINALS.    🇺🇸<sep>🇺🇸. Totally agree.   Trump has been the greatest US President of our times.   For decades the Democrat Politicians  have been buying the Latino votes with beer, while making empty promises.   They have used poverty women to do ballot harvesting etc.    Those times no more.  Latinos value America and want Trump who has proven he places America first even though Biden has weaponized the AG, DOJ, Big Tech, FBI and Media plus Rinos like Liz to destroy Trump.

Its just how it is.<sep>Full blown nightmare narcissist Trump is.<sep>Pathetic.<sep>Lucifer<sep>I love Trump but the thing he did is a Blasphemy<sep>That guys a clown and a dud<sep>هذا مراهق عجوز مجنون نسأل الله العافية والسلامه<sep>Trump must read 😯 Titus 3:2 , he has so many Bibles in all his homes I&#39;m sure he has seen it before 😊<sep>Pathetic<sep>There was an adaptation of a couple of verses from Proverbs 22 set to kind of an indie folk pop with some Vaudeville to the style, that might have been something both religious and non-religious people could listen to and appreciate.    It wasn&#39;t exactly a Paul Hester to Bernie Hester kind of thing, however, it would have been a quirky music scene joke along with a song like Green and Blues by The Pixies.    The theory about how many arguments there are about it being kept to the rock set, would be, they were trying to create a new hymnal that sort of went on holding when somebody didn&#39;t die.  Some people wondered if they are still whining about when they didn&#39;t die in the 70&#39;s.  If you read Fatal Decision the Jack Chick comic?  They said no to toxic medications. For some reason, I don&#39;t think it would be the band the Pixies that would be like that about any of that David in the Wilderness mix from ...the early 2000&#39;s?  Don&#39;t Dream it&#39;s Over, huh.  Would you believe there might have been an &quot;Oakie&quot; OZ that didn&#39;t have a Donald Trump character with a big bushy mustache and Jersey delivery or a whirlwind?  They could still have some techno on a episode of the Apprentice though.  Had he considered the Pet Shop Boys? Opportunities, anybody?<sep>In the eyes of god they our no borders 😅<sep>😂😂😂😂😂😂<sep>YES….🙌 Jesus brought trump to save us😂😂😂😂😂GTFOOH. 😂😂Clowns. WORST MISTAKE IN AMERICA HISTORY. WHAT IDIOTS VOTED FOR THIS BIG DIMMIE<sep>Mi dispiace per l America un grande paese ma gli ultimi presidenti non sono degni di rappresentare il popolo americano. Trump e biden intendo<sep>No one is without sin. We all recognize that. But it&#39;s astonishing that he has so many people deceived. His entire adult life is contradictory to whatever religious convictions he pretends to have. He&#39;s play-acting and only his sheep don&#39;t see it.<sep>Two Corinthians walk into a bar...<sep>Garbage news organization<sep>Fakenn clown 🤡<sep>How can that phony keep a straight face<sep>Trump is a Hypocrite.<sep>Nothing wrong with Bible. <br>Trump 2024.❤Maga again. <br>Biden  Christian what he did for us<sep>I purchased my Bible when I was young. Most people I know also paid for their bible. Trump haters say<sep>2 Corinthians 2:17  Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit.<sep>Trumps main commandment. MAKE MONEY scamming the poor!!<sep>He&#39;s selling Satanic bibles, not the Christian bibles..<sep>To be honest ......I really am surprised he just didn&#39;t burst into flames holding onto the Holy scripture!!!!!<sep>Does trump&#39;s bible condone adultery, grabbing women by their p--sy and sexually assaulting women?<sep>Fool.  Trump is a joke of a president.  Dumb as he has shown as president.  Dumb are those who dollowed this moron &quot;orange hair guy&quot;.<sep>THIS MAN IS THE DEVIL&#39;S SON!!<sep>Grab em by the Pu$$y!<sep>A D!ckhead in the flesh!<sep>He is directly profiting off Christians, I wonder what Jesus would think?  Remember the money-changers in the temple, he reminds me of the money-changers - making a buck off the followers.<sep>BLA BLA BLA BLA WHAT A JOKE YOU ARE PIECE OF $#!÷<sep>Something is better than Nothing God  Bless America<sep>When Jesus was around Trump was already exchanging money in all the churches for a buck. God, why can conservative see this man for what he is. I could understand farmer who vote for Trump, they were getting 100,000 dollar checks yearly from him as a hand out ( subsidy) but people who read the bible aught to know better.<sep>Absolutely ridiculous! Shoes, bibles, - what&#39;s next?  Trump toilet paper?  Now that WOULD sell, particularly if his silly face was printed on each sheet. If an ex president like Trump didn&#39;t actually exist, no one in their right mind would believe such a person could possibly be considered for the highest office in the country. Poor, poor America. What has happened?<sep>The WASHINGTON POST should be ashamed of themselves but they’re not. Their Propaganda &amp; Misleading Headlines knows absolutely no bounds.<br>“Trump Sells Bibles After Years Of Touting His Biblical Knowledge” is just an outright LIE, it’s not even misleading, Trump nor any of his organizations are selling Bibles. President Trumps Bishop is auctioning off signed copies for Charity &amp; using Trumps Platform to spread the word about the Bible. This is a complete garbage lie &amp; it’s disgusting that the Washington Times would actually involve the Bible to push their LIES &amp; FALSE NARRATIVES. I don’t care what your religion is, what your ideology is, what your ethnicity is, Everyone should be calling out these Lying Propagandist. It might not bother you now because you hate Trump but when people on all sides don’t call this BS out eventually the pendulum will swing &amp; it’ll be someone you support or listen to that will be labeling them with LIES &amp; PROPAGANDA. Seriously, Americans need to start calling these LYING media organizations. They are the reason our Country is going to hell. They play off people’s emotions with Clickbait &amp; can careless about the truth. The Washington Times obviously thinks people are so stupid they won’t catch on, and unfortunately as of now, reading the comments, The Washington Times is right. They’ll make a FAKE HEADLINE &amp; then let everyone spread their LIES without anyone doing any due diligence.. it’s so sad that this is what our Nation has become..<sep>How did he get that BIBLE to not burst into flames 🔥<sep>Shame on this guy.

t7xDb82TqiI,Nvidia's Ceo On Greatness | Jensen Huang,"Original Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEg8cOx7UZkIn this thought-provoking video, Jensen Huang, known for his influential role in the tech industry, shares a counterintuitive perspective on success and resilience. He suggests that individuals with very high expectations often possess lower resilience, which can be detrimental to achieving long-term success. Highlighting the importance of resilience, Jensen candidly shares his unconventional wish for others to experience suffering. He believes that enduring hardship is essential in cultivating resilience and shaping character, elements he views as foundational to achieving greatness.Jensen elaborates on how he integrates the concept of ""pain and suffering"" into the culture of his company, not with malice but with a sense of purpose. By embracing challenges and difficulties, he aims to refine the character of his team, pushing beyond mere intelligence to foster true greatness. This approach underscores the belief that character development, driven by overcoming adversity, is more crucial to success than intelligence alone.This video is a powerful reminder of the value of resilience in the path to success. Jensen Huang's message encourages viewers to reevaluate their relationship with hardship and resilience. For entrepreneurs, leaders, and individuals striving for excellence, the video offers a unique perspective on the importance of enduring and learning from life's challenges. It's a compelling call to embrace the trials we face, not as mere obstacles but as opportunities to develop the resilience and character required for true greatness.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xDb82TqiI,"Wow<sep>His analogy and wording comes off as hurtful however, I understand his reasoning behind P&amp;S it can be of benefit liking of heated steel, once it reaches the proper temp which can be re-transformed or re-molded or re-crafted into a person of great character and discernment.

The session was incredible, with fresh and cute details, my observation would be for the editing as the photos are great but if I do not look behind the scenes I would not go against the wall because Selena looks tall and flabby compared to Photos that make it look more broken (with curves and stylized) just that and for me loses charm that does not reflect reality but is highlighted with lighting effects or whatever is something that there is. Like saying that the camera grows fat, anyway.

Why are they thanking him? The actual words she is saying are just flowery phrases &quot;made the working class the hero of every story&quot;?<sep>Crime is NOT down in America.

The answer is obvious , because Mr. Biden would have  defeated Mr. Kennedy in the primary election, had Kennedy contested. The Kennedy  clan decided to endorse Mr. Biden  instead of their own family member is a family decision and a testament to Mr. Biden&#39;s reach within the democratic elites.<sep>She looks like she has no soul!

Mas talvez viesse a resolver o problema econômico de pessoas que são donos de grandes empresas de farmácias, até porque, toda vez que eu, e/ou outra pessoa, vai até uma farmácia, comprar um medicamento, nós provavelmente estamos ajudando a enriquecer ainda mais os donos de farmácia.<sep>Oh Look a Liar.<br>Maga go elect a criminal.<sep>God speed and HIS plan for you President Trump.<sep>I  say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement: and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, THOU FOOL, shall be in danger of HELL FIRE!!! I&#39;m comin for ya satan! Your end is near(: <br><br>O death, how you have hid yourself in the depths of the Seas. Although, I have found the presence of many beautiful things around you. Yet, you have immersed yourself in places not known to man. But I, your Master, have rediscovered your whereabouts. Only to find that you have lost your sting on not only mankind, but my Beloved planet entirely. Since the foundations of creation were laid, your predecessor made you his choice protégée, using you in all of his most secret and heinous schemes. He adored you and made you one with himself. Notwithstanding his need for your assistance, he hated you as much as himself. For he is the epitome of hate, which makes you the same as well. Moreover, your brother fear and your sister lust have used you likewise, only to empower you to the point that you became the one I hate most. I repent not at your calamity, and give praise to the day of your destruction. For that is what you are, destruction itself. I bet you never thought I would use your very nature as the one thing to eliminate you. You have annihilated nations, governments, families, marriages, friendships, wildlife, vegetation, and all other forms of life and goodness. You have forsaken the ordinances of Heaven and therefor created havoc on Earth. You have taken far too many of my sons and caused them to descend down into the pit. Providently, the grace of God, the Father of all things has given me the seal of approval to resurrect them all, leaving you, your father pride, and all other sadistic principalities formless and void. To be specific, you are without an Earthly home. I am sending the collection of you all beyond the cosmic horizon, where you will find the great lake of fire, the abyss. Upon arrival you shall regain form while being forced into the designated bodies I have created for you. Why? Because you must suffer. Once each of you have found your extra-terrestrial temple, I will slowly but surely dip and submerge you into the place where you shall abode forevermore, leaving no trace of sin, or darkness, or hate, or death to consume our Universe ever again.<sep>THIS CHANNEL SUPPORTS D.J.

Now there is a difficult political situation in your state because of Biden, Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin suspended international agreements and relations with you in order to save your life, because if the President of Russia continued to conduct international negotiations with you, Biden would have intervened in these negotiations and tried to remove you from the political arena because he he would consider that you are preventing him from pursuing a policy towards the destruction and genocide of the Ukrainian people by turning Ukraine into a fascist Bandera state in favor of Bider. Your task is to win the elections in 2024 with all your efforts, after your victory in the elections, Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin resumed relations with you and with all your efforts you will resolve the conflict in Ukraine. And also if you discuss the issue with Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin on helping to restore the automotive industry in the United States, I believe that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin will help you with this after Biden loses the election.<sep>Open the flood gates President Trump. We will calm our families and take charge of the rest peacefully. Have faith in us and please get this over with now.<sep>we need a president who is not old, a president who cares what happens after they die, a true and young partiot who understands the futre. i love president trump, but i need something that relates to me, the present and future.<sep>Maga terrorists.<sep>As part of President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act, nearly four million seniors on Medicare with diabetes started to see their insulin costs capped at $35 per month this past January, saving some seniors hundreds of dollars for a month’s supply. But in his State of the Union, President Biden made clear that this life-saving benefit should apply to everyone, not just Medicare beneficiaries.<br>This week, Eli Lilly, the largest manufacturer of insulin in the United States is lowering their prices and meeting that call.<br>Eli Lilly announced they are lowering the cost of insulin by 70% and capping what patients pay out-of-pocket for insulin at $35. This action, driven by the momentum from the Inflation Reduction Act, could benefit millions of Americans with diabetes in all fifty states and U.S. territories.

They haven[&#39;t been screwing anyone over, but it MUST be understood that they cannot hire anyone from those previously mentioned defunct agencies.

He did not win! It was rigged<sep>We all have regrets…. Fortunately, that is not one of mine. 😆😝<sep>Elon never answered the question, he did a great job of flanking it, but he never, actually committed and answered it.<sep>Elon, just say it! He fucking SUCKS! No, I’m not voting for him<sep>Little shocked why Elon would have fallen for Biden.<sep>FREE SPEECH DONT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO HATE SPEECH STOP USING THE R WORD REGARDLESS OF WHO ITS TO ITS MUCH MORE WORSE THAN THE N WORD ITS OFFENSIVE TO DISABILITY PEOPLE REGARDLESS IF IT IS  DIRECTLY TOWARDS THEM OR NOT. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rosalaw"">#ROSALAW</a>!<sep>Elon voted for Biden? Wow, I feel smarter than Elon Musk.<sep>Lmao 🤣<sep>Mira y tú sigues saliendo<sep>BS !!!!!<sep>I knew BEFORE he was pres he was going to be bad for the economy and bad for America. His policies have proven it.<sep>I so admire Elon Musk but there is NO WAY Biden got 81 million votes…more in the history of any Presidential campaign??<sep>I admit. I’m Nigerian, voted for Biden and deeply regret my vote. Honestly have issues sleeping at night knowing I contributed to this mess. Waiting for the next election to pay my retribution<sep>Biden 😂 Elon Musk with him now on…<sep>Trump is disgrace of a human and you people are still deluding yourselves.<sep>I&#39;m kinda annoyed w/Musk. He influenced people to vote for Biden, no doubt. Now he&#39;s responsible for putting this AI disaster out into the world.<sep>Why is Elon not at work?<sep>I was standing by him but I am tired of trying to get a hold of him the white settlement policeman told me to walk to Washington I think I going to try it Dakota Bryan Kuhn<sep>Even smart people make stupid mistakes. Most importantly, don’t make the same stupid mistake to make more stupid mistakes. You don’t have many chances and much time to make things better because some mistakes you just can’t reverse them.<sep>How can such a smart individual make such a dumb decision? Maybe Musk isn&#39;t as smart as he makes out to be.<sep>I’d like to read more about why Joe has been shite rather than ‘he’s old’. Does anyone know of any good references/articles so far reviewing his presidency?<br><br>And another thought, the promises which Joe got elected with, has he had relative success enacting them?<sep>I am sigma<sep>白灯下清明节闹鬼<sep>Everybody makes mistakes. Just so we learn from them. That’s something I can hear you say. 🥰🥰❤️<sep>Please don’t vote for Biden this time.<sep>Biden won? How, by taking a nap in his basement?<sep>For all those Congress lovers in India this is for you too<sep>Bidens condition is a scam so he gets out of prison<sep>I reckon Elon could do an Aussie accent. Thats saying something. The dude is the real deal and for the betterment of the world. And hes givin it a red hot go.<sep>I believe he won because he cheated.<sep>If you want to know what kind of man  Elon Musk is, just consider the facts that he&#39;s the wealthiest man in the world and he&#39;s South African but he hasn&#39;t done anything for South Africa even though their natural resources is the reason his parents are wealthy and helped him to be in the position he is smh NEVER trust majority of white South Africans.<sep>Elon  you a very wise businessman with good morals ... but I can&#39;t believe that you did your due diligence, and examine biden&#39;s track record before you voted, .... but at least you&#39;re honest and you owned up to it.<sep>And I looked up to you Mr Musk .  But i remembered something my dad told me - really smart people do not have any common sense, I see that now<sep>So Elon was also an idiot<sep>He voted Biden..<br>My opinion of him just went down alot<sep>Elon should have known Biden was a fuckup<sep>I cant believe you voted for that incapable being<sep>lol so clearly doesn’t like trump.. good 👍🏻😊<sep>He can smoke weed with Joe Rogan on camera, but he can&#39;t be questioned by a black American interviewer, who is also intelligent. Why do the interview if you&#39;re going to glitch out like R2D2 on meds?Im sure that elon knew that Dom was black, before the interview.He folded like a chair on this interview. Dom definitely came out on top.All of his fans think that he won something over Dom, and All black people know that Dom won the interview. 😮😮😮<sep>WHY?<sep>I would hope all of who voted for a candidate ridden w dementia, who lied to all American citizens, broke his presidential oath w/i 5mins of taking, Has put this country he vowed to protect &amp; its citizens in dire danger by having unprotected  borders, &amp; letting 10million plus illegal immagrants w every disease thruout the world &amp; unleash all into our country especially after just dealing w covid!! US citizens were mandated on having multiple immunizations that were not significantly tested..many Americans lost their jobs over not complying w putting foriegn substances into our bodies! More had serious side effects! Left w serious conds! Pssbly even deaths of young men! BUT the illegals roaming across our country didnt need anything immunizations!! Then how many murders, rapist, child molesters, human sex traffickers, drug smuggling, violent gangs, ect terrorists plotting, waiting, on attacking the US..&amp; our country which in turn means our tax paying citizens have to support them all &amp; their children for the rest of our lives! Food, housing, clothing, medical, special schooling w interpreters for all languages, special busing..(ive seen in local walmart w carriages filled w items!)taking schools, housing complexes for elderly, ect away frm our children, our elderly so they can have! While our people in need go to the back of the line w/o!! The massive debt biden has put is in for other foriegn countries! Just printing up the $ we dont have &amp; handing out to the most ridiculous causes(look it up on where theyve sent &amp; how many billions to ea, made up, goes in the dirty dems pockets! We will never b able to pay back or get caught up &amp; our children, grandchildren, extended generations will b responsible for paying &amp; they life they could have had, that they deserve! No longer will they b able to afford bcuz of biden! He dosent care about Myself, my family, U or yours, the ignorant who voted for him! Our economy is terrible! Food that we need to live, for our children has gone sky high &amp; rising! Everything has gone up &amp; up..gas we need to get to work has cost us more! He took right out of our backyards! We could have had our own fuel..biden axed it! Hes divided this whole country, the whole race situation has bcom out of control due to biden &amp; his VP! He stands w all these crazy ideologies, the worst one ive ever known against our young children, putting laws in place, taking parents rights away, supporting hormone blockers, injections to get children sex changes, mutilate their bodies!!! Our very young children! NO stop the craziness! These Democrats have a very dangerous agenda going on! Ect, ect..everything joe biden can do to eviscerate our country, the US he is doing he has done! Our dementia ridden President, U voted for &amp; r the cause of all the destruction! So i hope u who did vote for him, r smart enough not to this Nov election! Or its on your heads what will bcome of our country! U will actually get what u deserve! &amp; the crying of your family, your childrens future&#39;s that was stollen frm them, future wars, deaths, middle class w b like a 3rd world country! Man against man..i cannot imagine how our country will exist as we&#39;ve always known! They will take frm us! Do whats right to save the US &amp; our citizens! Thank u..Americans!<sep>Yeah, If Elon is so smart, why did he vote for Biden? <br>Hahaha, WOW!<sep>bidin has NO morals<sep>He regrets<sep>He didn&#39;t fucking win and everyone knows it. Trump had more than 100M votes in 2020. 🇺🇲<sep>Of course he voted for Biden, he is deep state after all<sep>Elon owes me gas and grocery money. And an apology!<sep>Frickin 🐐❤<sep>How could you not regret it dude<sep>Trump would give me a big unpaid for tax cut because I’m super wealthy<sep>Wow this clown voted for Biden?<sep>Brandon is a puppet of the far left....STOP voting for democraps<sep>Goes to show not all the choices Elon makes are good. Space X will not work sir…all the GREAT engineers work for the govt. Your insurance plans, and 401k arent as good. LOL<sep>Elon should cut the bs and be honest, he is not that smart if he voted for Joe.<sep>Oh No!! just goes to show, one can Not be smart at everything, So disappointed Elon your better than that!!<sep>The most brainwashing video there is. Is a caricature of how propaganda works.<sep>Elon is brilliant, could definitely tell he didn&#39;t wanna admit he messed up voting for Biden. You weren&#39;t alone in that mistake, Elon.<sep>An honest man! Own your sh!t…and then do better 🙌<sep>Come on Elon Musk. I thought you was a pretty smart man. Even a dumbass knows Biden was installed like a toilet💩<sep>Biden is Mr. Super 1D10T is a joke embarrassing  United States.<sep>Imagine if this guy was president. He is the most respected guy there is<sep>If he votes for Biden again I’m deleting X<sep>Way to go Elon class style without hurting Biden careing of presentation over all<sep>Of course he won!   With fake ballots!<sep>Biden cheated period he stole the election period.<sep>Musk how can you be so smart and vote for Biden doesn&#39;t make sense<sep>To all you people critiquing Elon simply for doing something you disagree with, keep in mind that your “leader,” Trump, was a democrat for most of his life.<sep>Puppets only need apply for the godfather&#39;s approval.<sep>I am so glad I didn’t vote for Biden 😂<sep>For someone as smart as him to vote for Biden and be easily deceived is wild<sep>Well. He&#39;s not going to go into direct opposition to trump is he.?. The possibility of carving up the country between the two of them is frightening in the extreeme.<sep>We will vote for the mean business man over ANY career politician 🇺🇲 <br> AGAIN 🇺🇲<sep>I dont believe Biden won...he just wants to stay out of trouble<sep>👍🏽<sep>Baffoon Biden is No CEO<sep>Elon musk fanboy<sep>Even the smartest people can have no common sense<sep>Not so smart if ya couldnt see Biden was clearly not the right choice, from the get go<sep>That is the stupidest comment from the most intelligent man I&#39;ve ever seen. Yes you need a good executive but the values are also an absolute must.<sep>Well I thought he was a genius until he said he believed he won.<sep>No more respect for Musk<sep>Watching Biden attend to his executive matters makes me think of a universe where Rick from Rick and Morty is ruling a planet while under heavy drugs.<sep>😶‍🌫️what is the outcome 🫠<sep>Plz show video dates. People change their views. I doubt he supports Biden now!<sep>Being honest is important and every person is entitled to their opinion and beliefs.<sep>ROLAND MARTIN said DEMOCRATS GET THINGS DONE... BUILD BACK BETTER,  INFLATION REDUCTION ACT.. .  No democrats will explain these 2 bills they&#39;ve passed. 😂<sep>It don’t matter who you are you knew what that scumbag was and you still voted for him… I’m cutting ties with Elon.<sep>Elon did you go to any of Biden’s “rallies”? Bwa haha ha ha 😂<sep>We rate those who believe Joe won right with the tooth fairy and leprechaun’s.<sep>😂😂😂<sep>Why would you vote dor biden elon? Your so smart yet you voted for biden, i don&#39;t get it<sep>Someone who can&#39;t walk, talk, walk up stairs, gets lost on the Whitehouse lawn, looks around and calls out for his mother at rallies when she has been dead for years, claims to have recently talked with someone that&#39;s been dead since 96, confuses his sister for his wife, confuses secret service for salvation army workers, shakes hands with invisible people, can&#39;t open a door and literally on multiple occasions can&#39;t find his way off a stage! &quot;Describe America in a single word: ASUFUTIMAEHAEHFUTBW!&quot; - Joe Biden<sep>Biden  ha ha come on man<sep>I’m at a loss for words. He clearly just cares about himself and not the rest of the country if he voted for Biden. Everyone’s suffering in the us . Not Elon tho. He don’t care that you suffering. He knew Biden would  raise gas prices and hoped we would switch to electric cars. Fuck tesla fuck Biden and fuck Elon musk<sep>He deserves a share in the blame for all the horrible things Biden has done to this country. This guy’s supposed to be smart — how has he swallowed the propaganda?<sep>He didn&#39;t vote for Biden<sep>Biden is doing for the American people not corporate billionaires<sep>Wikipedia:   Thomas McInerney (born March 7, 1937) is a political commentator and a retired United States Air Force Lieutenant General. Mr. McInerney uploaded a few videos in 2020 showing proof positive that the 2020 election was rigged by thousands of votes electronically taken from Trump and transferred over to Biden.<sep>I voted for him and I regret it completely. That grandpa either belong to Jail or senior home.",0
